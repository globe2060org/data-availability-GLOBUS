AB Reducing energy consumption in the building sector, which contributes to 30% of energy-related, global CO2 emissions, is of crucial importance in mitigating climate change. Vernacular architectural elements such as windcatchers have been a paramount model in modern sustainable architecture to provide energy-efficient cooling and ventilation using natural forces of wind and buoyancy. Yet the range of climatic conditions in which windcatchers can be widely used and their role in the indoor air quality are unknown. Particularly, despite the widespread use of vernacular windcatchers in desert regions, it is unclear why they have not been applied in mountainous areas. We report on the only vernacular windcatcher in a mountainous region with a Mediterranean-to-cold climate in Western Iran and use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, long-time climate data, and psychrometric analyses to investigate the reasons for the failure of this windcatcher in becoming widespread in mountainous regions. Our CFD simulation results for a broad range of ambient wind speeds demonstrate that the overall performance of the windcatcher set on the roof of Emad-o-Dowlah Mosque, Kermanshah, Iran, is on average comparable with modern windcatchers studied previously and is significantly (p-value = 0.001) better than natural ventilation and cooling systems merely consisting of window and door openings (by 101%).
   We further show that while climatic conditions of the region necessitate the use of windcatchers during summer daytime, and the windcatcher's performance is satisfactory in terms of providing comfort, it requires certain technology to shut it off in the night-time that was previously lacking. These results indicate that with today's technology windcatchers are applicable over a broader climatic condition than hitherto expected. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A compact urban form has shown many benefits in efficiency. Yet multiple studies have found that residents of urban, dense, and centrally located areas travel more frequently than those living in suburbs, small towns, or the countryside. As air travel is already causing more emissions than ground transport in many affluent urban locations and is predicted to increase, this pattern could undermine efforts in climate change mitigation. Explanations of these patterns and motivations for long-distance travel connected to the built environment have been examined quantitatively before, but with inconclusive answers. We studied this topic qualitatively in Reykjavik, Iceland, offering an in-depth perspective through semi-structured interviews. Results showed various links between the urban environment and long-distance travel. Some indications of compensatory travel behavior emerged, particularly connected to a lack of quality green areas, hectic urban life, and commuting stress. Compensatory trips were typically domestic. Furthermore, residential preferences seemed connected to leisure travel preferences-living in green neighborhoods was connected to more domestic travel to nature. The results show there are more factors for 'escape' trips than urban density and lack of green spaces. Examples of car-free lifestyles hindering domestic leisure travel were also found. Our study shows how a qualitative approach offers nuanced insight into the travel motivations of urbanites. Considering our results and travel motivation literature, the compensation hypothesis appears to be an overly narrow theoretical framing. Our study supports the conclusion that planning policies should aim at reducing car-dependence. Further research is needed for specific policy recommendations.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The long-term forecasting of the energy demand is an important issue of an area's sustainable development, especially for mega cities such as Beijing. Beijing is changing its energy supply strategy to depend on energy imports from other provinces due to the city's long-term low carbon sustainable development plan. Beijing has promised that it will reach the peak value of energy consumption by 2050 and the peak value of the carbon emissions by 2030. To understand whether this can be achieved, this study built an energy demand simulation model using the LEAP with different development scenarios. The results show that, the peak value of Beijing's energy demand is between 108.25 and 131.74 Mtce during the period of 2044 to 2048, while the peak value of carbon emissions is between 134 and 139.38 million tons in 2025. We also find that adjusting the industry structure and improving the tertiary industry's energy usage efficiency can be efficient ways to reduce energy consumption. These approaches not only reduce the negative influence of the economic development, but also achieve the energy saving and carbon emission reducing requirements. This study provides an interpretation of the implications for the future energy and climate policies of Beijing.

ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; PREDICTION
AB Space heating with gas as the primary fuel is a dominant contributor of residential energy consumption in UK and hence important for achieving UK's 2050 carbon targets. Whilst most cities in the UK have reduced their emissions per capita, there is a large variation of domestic gas consumption within cities. Past research suggests that the variations in gas consumption are as much as function of the quality of built environment, as it is of wider socio-economic-demographic features of households. Their combined influence on variations of residential heating consumption is however not well understood. This paper proposes a novel two-layer clustering framework to address this gap. The proposed framework constitutes of Gaussian Mixture Models and Hierarchical clustering and is illustrated through the analysis of residential gas consumption across London. Results show eight clusters of London Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) explained along 18 dimensions that include built-environment, social-economic and demographic information. These 8 clusters are used as variables to further cluster four groups of local authorities. The distinct gas consumption related properties of the resulting clusters explain the sources of variations in gas consumption across clusters and indicate possible directions for future fine-tuning of local policies.

AB Integrated energy planning (IEP) plays vital role in the promotion of energy efficiency in large-scale building stock. IEP can facilitate the evaluation of energy supply and demand in current rural and urban areas for the proper allocation of available resources. This paper presents a comprehensive review of large-scale energy planning and a systematic review of the methods employed in urban and regional integrated energy planning (UR-IEP). To this effect, 234 models from 157 published papers have been collected, classified based on their aims and methodologies, and critically subjected to meta-analysis and SWOT table. Thus, this review propones a framework of the fundamental concepts in energy model design and detailed analysis to support decision-making. Further, it provides a clear comparison of the methods and characterises them based on seven basic criteria of energy models, including purpose, methodology, analytical approach, geographical coverage, mathematical approach, time horizon, and data requirements. This framework provides urban planners with accurate and helpful basis for the selection of appropriate IEP methods based on the most common-focused methods published between 1960 and 2018.

AB Accurate simulation of planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is key to greenhouse gas emission estimation, air quality prediction, and weather forecasting. This paper describes an extensive performance assessment of several Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model configurations in which novel observations from ceilometers, surface stations, and a flux tower were used to study their ability to reproduce the PBLH and the impact that the urban heat island (UHI) has on the modeled PBLHs in the greater Washington, D.C., area. In addition, CO2 measurements at two urban towers were compared with tracer transport simulations. The ensemble of models used four PBL parameterizations, two sources of initial and boundary conditions, and one configuration including the building energy parameterization urban canopy model. Results have shown low biases over the whole domain and period for wind speed, wind direction, and temperature, with no drastic differences between meteorological drivers. We find that PBLH errors are mostly positively correlated with sensible heat flux errors and that modeled positive UHI intensities are associated with deeper modeled PBLs over the urban areas. In addition, we find that modeled PBLHs are typically biased low during nighttime for most of the configurations with the exception of those using the MYNN parameterization, and these biases directly translate to tracer biases. Overall, the configurations using the MYNN scheme performed the best, reproducing the PBLH and CO2 molar fractions reasonably well during all hours and thus opening the door to future nighttime inverse modeling.

AB Increasing the use of sustainably sourced wood in construction for temporal carbon storage could be one vital part in the transition towards reaching the sustainable development goals for climate action and sustainable cities and communities. This paper explains the detailed steps from the planning to the realization process and shows how building with wood could be linked to the entire process from the sales of building plots to the realization of projects. Additionally, based on EN 15978, life cycle assessment (LCA) results of the constructed buildings were conducted to calculate the realistic carbon storage and the global warming potential for all new erected buildings on the site. The case study area and living lab is a building site in Munich with 566 flats, which will be finished in 2020 and will be the largest urban timber neighborhood in Germany by then. All development activities are summarized under the concept of building an eco-city with low carbon emissions and a high standard for living for all groups of inhabitants. Eight buildings with different material selections ranging from wood-constructions to wood-concrete hybrid constructions and concrete constructions with different energy standards are environmentally assessed. Results show that about 12.5 million kg of CO(2)are stored in the wooden structures over the estimated life cycle of 50 years within this neighborhood. This clearly demonstrates the potential that building with wood has for achieving climate targets. Further results show that heating energy demand and material choices have a significant influence on LCA results.

AB Purpose The purpose of the study is to assess performance of local level planning policies that required new buildings to avoid a specified and rising proportion of projected greenhouse gases (GHGs) from their use; it is calculated based on the approved design and plans for the specific development and through the installation and operation of low and zero-carbon generating technologies (LZCGTs). Design/methodology/approach Data were extracted from a random sample of 911 new builds from 403 planning applications and related documents, across five Scottish local planning authorities (LPAs) who adopted GHG reduction policies. The data included GHG reduction, LZCGT installation and performance, use of plan designs to meet GHG reductions and exemptions from the GHG policies. Descriptive statistics using SPSS software, complimented by qualitative responses from questionnaires, helped to explain observed performance. Findings The policies performed poorly, at the level of delivering low-hanging fruits, with significant room for improvement. Design-led opportunities in the GHG policies were not actively pursued; most LZCGT installation was exempted from GHG policies and the policies were poor in targeting the relationship between building unit size, GHG emission and reductions. Research limitations/implications The source documents, where the data came from, had varying quality and completeness and some LPAs are over-represented in the data. The study applied limited criteria to evaluate policy performance. Practical implications Areas for policymakers to further focus on when exploring how to enhance role and performance of LZCGT are highlighted, including practical suggestions. Originality/value One of the few studies assessing policy performance and distilling lessons, from early adopters of GHG policies at local level planning, offer performance benchmarks and raise points of concern for policymakers.

AB Korea has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) to levels 37% below the "business as usual (BAU)" level by 2030, and the building sector, in particular, aims to reduce GHGEs by 45,000,000-ton CO2-eq by 2020. In order to reach this goal, it is crucial to reduce GHGEs that result from energy consumption in apartment buildings, which account for approximately 65% of all buildings in the capital region where the population is concentrated. Moreover, as apartment buildings not only have high window-to wall area ratios, but also use insulating glazing (IG) with low thermal performance, an advanced window system with low heat transmittance (U-value), such as a concrete structure, is necessary for effective GHGE reduction. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the GHGE reduction effects from replacing existing IG vacuum insulating glazing (VIG) with low U-values in the apartment housing located in the capital region. The analysis revealed the possibility of a GHGE reduction by 45%-79% with the application of commercial VIG with U-values of 0.7 W/m(2)K in lieu of the existing IG with U-values ranging from 1.2 to 3.3 W/m(2)K for all apartment buildings located in the capital region. Furthermore, GHGEs could be reduced by 82%-93% by replacing the existing IG with VIG with U-values of 0.2 W/m(2)K.

AB We have developed an energy-saving operations system featuring remote operation of central monitoring equipment installed in a building. This system applies robotic process automation to remote operation to automatically perform energy-saving operations on behalf of the operations manager. Furthermore, as another feature, the system requires only a local area network to connect to the central monitoring equipment enabling automatic operation to be performed regardless of the specifications of the central monitoring equipment. The items targeted for energy-saving operation by this system are the optimal operation of a heat source system, setting of the supply water temperature of heat source equipment, setting of room temperature, and setting of outside-air intake volume. At present, the operations manager has the role of performing these energy-saving operations, but finding the optimal value for each of these operations is a difficult task. An operations manager, moreover, is responsible for tasks other than facility operations such as maintenance management, so changing optimal settings accurately at regular intervals on an ongoing basis can be quite a burden. This system uses robotic process automation technology, so it is capable of performing all energy-saving operations that can be executed by the central monitoring equipment. We installed this system in a large-scale shopping mall and performed energy-saving operations on outside-air processing units. In this trial, we achieved a 44% reduction in the amount of energy required for outside-air processing and a 47% reduction in CO2 emissions.

AB Despite their great significance, lightweight structures have poor thermal inertia. In order to enhance the thermal comfort inside such buildings, architects need lightweight thermal storage. In this paper a model was used to experimentally investigate Heating Load profiles in lightweight shelters. The profiles were created for the climate in Jordan, then simulated for other climate zones. The proposed design concept was used to create a replacement for a thermal mass in lightweight structures such as shelters; by combining passive solar gain with energy storage embodied within the shelter floor (thermal-floor) to absorb solar radiation. This shelter design decreased the Heating Load during the winter season by acting as heat storage that releases energy at night time after being exposed to solar radiation during the day. The passive design depends on shading elements and overhangs shades to control solar gain during different seasons to prevent overheating during the summer. An experimental investigation of this model was performed to validate the simulation results. Validated simulation results showed that the designed thermal-floor is 25 % of the total shelter's floor area, which was crucial for obtaining favourable results. With CO2 as a thermal mass, heat load was reduced up to 68 % compared to a 20 cm concrete slab floor. The use of this thermal storage material yielded a reduction in annual heating demand by 85 kWh/m(2).

AB In Pakistan, an increase in the urban population in recent decades has led to rising demand for energy and so has consequently increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In this study, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted on a sample of 300 residential buildings in Lahore, and their CO(2)e emissions from electricity and natural gas consumption were calculated using IPCC methodology. The results show that both electricity and natural gas consumption released 7.65 MMtCO(2)e during the one-year study period. It was found that income class (p<0.001), house area (p<0.001), the size (tons) of AC (p<0.001), number of kitchens (p<0.01), building type (p<0.001) and season (p<0.001) had a significantly positive relationship with energy consumption and CO(2)e emissions. Conversely, roof insulation (p<0.01) had a significantly negative relationship with energy consumption and CO(2)e emissions. The study emphasizes the need of policy formulation to improve thermal characteristics of existing buildings and implementation of building energy codes for new housing construction. It is also recommended to raise awareness among dwellers for the adoption of energy conservation measures to reduce CO(2)e emissions.

AB A novel form-stable composite phase change materials for cold energy storage were prepared using physical blending adsorption method. In the shape-stabilized composites, lauryl alcohol (LA) and caprylic acid (CA) were employed as phase change materials, which were blended together at specific mass ratio based on theoretical calculations. Activated charcoal (AC) was selected as supporting material due to its advantages like large specific surface area and high thermal conductivity. The composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results of FE-SEM and FT-IR displayed that the eutectics of LA and CA was well absorbed and dispersed homogeneously into the porous network structure of the AC and the melted eutectics was not easy to leak from the reticular structure. Moreover, there was only physical absorption between the eutectic mixture and AC. The results of DSC and TGA indicated that phase change temperature and latent heat of the prepared composites increased with the increase of the binary eutectics mass ratio and AC can enhance the thermal stability of composites. The composites with the mass ratio 60% of the eutectics melted at - 0.21 degrees C with a latent heat enthalpy of 28.08 J/g and solidified at - 2.33 degrees C with a latent solidification enthalpy of 29.70 J/g. The prepared composites will contribute to cold energy storage of low temperature range.

AB Dominant share of the residential stock in the European countries has an exploited service life and is in a need for facade refurbishment. This paper contributes with an establishment of a tool for assessment of the sustainability of design options f or buildings' facade refurbishment. The tool is based on a multicriteria system, assessing four design criteria, relevant to the process of facade refurbishment. The criteria are evaluated by several surveyed participants by utilizing the Analytic-Hierarchic Process (AHP).The tool is applied on several facade refurbishment design proposals assessment on a case-study of a residential building situated in Skopje, Western Balkans, Europe. Each of the facade proposals is assessed regarding their energy performance, CO2 emissions, investment costs and return of investment. Further, the results of the LCA analysis of the applied materials shows the contribution of each of them to the overall sustainability performance. The results of this research show that the use of wood and modified wood products as facade elements used for buildings'facade refurbishment can substantially decrease the greenhouse emissions and contribute to the carbon offset. However, due to the higher investment costs, the return of the investment is longer, leading to lower sustainability assessment ranking. It is concluded that the refurbishment of the facade with a conventional contact facade has the highest ranking on sustainability, followed by facade refurbishment with contact facade combined with only roof refurbishment/glazing refurbishment or both. Also, the modified wood wall types show high sustainability ranking regarding their refurbishment potential.

AB Apropos to numerous environmental issues highlighted globally and locally, Malaysia has now moving forward towards new agenda of greening the cities. A positive movement trend of new green building in the country can be seen as number of projects going into green rating application are increasing yearly. Nevertheless, sustainability impact is considered as significantly small since newly developed green building represent small percentage as compared to the existing non-green building. Therefore. the idea of greening the existing building through refurbislunent emerged in order to achieve wider sustainability objectives. Apart from that, supported with recent evolvement of technology and digitalization in construction industry, in lieu with governments' strategies to adopt Industry 4.0, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has also been acknowledged and used broadly as a solution to integrate and facilitate management of information throughout building lifecycles. Considering these two areas; sustainability and BIM are continuously gaining momentum these days, this paper attempts to explore BIM's potentials as an enabler to help greening the existing non-green building. Literature review is conducted focus on reviewing BIM and sustainability present status in Malaysian construction industry, also their relationship including examining potential areas where BIM may contribute to enhance the buildings' sustainability performances. Based on the reviews, there is a potential of bridging the two areas considering both has becoming a national construction industry agenda since the government released CITP2016-2020. To further concur the ideas, literature reviews has also proven that the ability of BIM to facilitate various functions has enable it to support several sustainability analyses such as energy, carbon emission, lighting, water, materials and waste, building and site, and costing analysis.

AB The choice of materials may play an important role in achieving the common European aims of near zero energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the lifecycle of buildings. The production of timber materials demands lower emissions than concrete and steel. To guide political and industrial priorities, it is vital to estimate the emission effects of increased use of timber. The article reports on a broad study that had the following aims:
   1. To forecast the number, types, floor area, and location of new buildings that will be built in Oslo and Akershus counties between 2015 and 2030.
   2. To estimate how many of these new buildings (a) will be and (b) could be built with timber as the main construction material.
   3. To compare these timber potentials to the present and future availability of nationally and sustainably sourced and manufactured timber.
   4.To estimate the effect on GHG emissions when substituting concrete and steel with timber in the production of new buildings in Oslo and Akershus counties between 2015 and 2030. The research is based on official prognoses for population growth. They are combined with building predictions derived from municipal statistics and plans. A GHG reduction factor is extracted from existing studies of the effects of conversion to timber. This factor is used to estimate the GHG saving potentials of different scenarios for timber use. Main results: center dot The forecast of building numbers, categories, sizes and location is a useful tool when discussing environmental, urban, industrial and architectural strategies. center dot Housing in 2-8 stories, not high-rise buildings, represents the biggest potential for increased use of timber in Norway. center dot Scientific consensus is not established regarding timber buildings and emissions. Especially the effects of carbon storage in long-lived products and use of residues for biofuel substitutes fossil fuel are still debated. To convey an order of magnitude, the different emission-saving effects are separated. center dot The estimates of GHG mitigation indicate that conversion to use of timber may have significant effects, butmeasures in the transport sector aremore important for reaching the ambitious emission targets in Oslo and Akershus counties. center dot To be robust, the argument for timber buildings must include the perspective of a green industrial shift based on renewable resources and innovative technology, design and architecture. center dot The vicinity of Norway's biggest and most rapidly growing market for timber buildings and the country's largest forests and timber-based industries represents a unique opportunity for sustainable urban and regional development.

AB All countries, including developing ones, have set climate change and energy security as clear target goals. They have developed programs and policies to reach their energy security, emission reduction, and environmental mitigation goals. Colombia has notably developed programs to promote renewable energies and efficiency. However, there is still a need to quantify the impact that these policies could have in the future. The aim of this paper is to quantify the emissions prevented by the implementation of two proposed Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), for which we built Colombia's energy system model in order to understand its effects on GHG emissions. The first NAMA replaces old refrigerators that continue using CFC compounds with efficient refrigerators that use HCFC compounds. The second NAMA seeks to secure new energy supplies through renewable sources for areas not connected to the grid. We also created a scenario that integrates both NAMAs to understand their combined effects on GHG emissions. The simulation shows that both NAMAs will allow to prevent the emission of 4.71 million tons of CO2 equivalent by 2040, and that the faster they are implemented, the more GHG emissions will be avoided. The model is a framework available for further research in climate change mitigation and energy efficiency policies.

AB Multifamily residential sites (MRS) are practical alternatives for securing a carbon uptake source in urban areas where hardscape is dominant, as trees must be planted in the lot area, according to the current landscape-related ordinances in Korea. Tree planting contributes to sustainability of residential sites through carbon reduction. This study quantified direct and indirect carbon reduction from tree planting in MRS in Korea and explored sustainable design guidelines to maximize the carbon offset service of MRS. The total annual direct and indirect carbon reduction through tree planting in all the MRS was estimated to be about 101.1 kt/year. This carbon reduction equaled 3.3% of the total annual carbon emissions from the heating and cooling energy consumption of multifamily buildings. This study considered both direct and indirect carbon reduction from trees in MRS which was insufficient in previous studies. The results of this study can be useful internationally by sharing the information of sustainable residential design in enhancing carbon offset service.

AB Purpose There is a clear consensus that improving energy efficiency of existing housing stock is necessary to meet the UK's legally binding carbon emission targets by 2050. The purpose of this paper is to assess the energy saving potentials from building retrofit using an end-terrace house, similar houses represent about 30 per cent of the existing building stock in the UK. Design/methodology/approach The Salford Energy House - a unique pre-1919 Victorian end-terrace house built within an environmental chamber - was used. Retrofit modelling analysis was carried out using IESVE - a dynamic thermal simulation tool. The retrofitted model was also evaluated using future projected climate data (CIBSE latest release) to examine energy demands and overheating. Findings Findings show that improving building fabric thermal characteristics can reduce space heating demands substantially. Heating modes, set point preferences and infiltration level all have strong impact on heating demands. Space heating demand savings can be as much as 77 per cent when the property facades were upgraded to the similar requirements of Passivhaus standards. The research implicates that, for dwelling retrofit practices, a whole house holistic approach should be the preferred option to improve energy efficiency. With future climate scenarios where temperatures are potentially elevated, the heating demands can be potentially reduced as much as 27 per cent. Originality/value The research presented in this paper highlights the effectiveness of various retrofit measures individually as well as holistically, also the implications on energy demands and the likelihood of overheating in dwellings under future climate scenarios.

AB The building sector is considered a key area for sustainable development, due to the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the numerous economic activities that this sector involves. A low-cost lightweight cementitious composite consisting in perlite mortar was fabricated and evaluated. The thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the proposed composite were tested in the laboratory. The lightweight composite was integrated into a prototypical house and its thermal performance was tested for two different arid climates during a typical meteorological year. A techno-economic analysis of this integration was carried out, which showed the lightweight system integration could reduce the energy demand up to 10.3% due to the decreased use of heating and cooling systems. The CO2 emissions associated with electricity and gas use on cooling and heating systems could be reduced up to 10.9%.

AB District heating systems using cogeneration technology and renewable resources are considered as an effective approach to resources conservation and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, widespread aging and depopulation problems, as well as the popularization of energy-saving technologies in buildings, are estimated to greatly decrease energy consumption, leading to inefficiency in district heating and barriers to technology proliferation. From a long-term perspective, land use changes, especially the progression of compact city plans, have the potential to offset the decrement in energy consumption that maintains the efficiency of district heating systems. An integrated model is developed in this paper based on building cohort analysis to evaluate the economic feasibility and environmental impact of introducing district heating systems to a long-term compact city plan. As applied to a case in the Soma Region of Fukushima, Japan, potential migration from the suburbs to the central station districts is simulated, where district heating based on gas-fired cogeneration is expected to be introduced. The results indicate that guided migration to produce concentrated centers of population can substantially increase the heat demand density, which supports a wider application of district heating systems and better low-carbon performance. These results are further discussed in relation to technology innovation and related policies. It is concluded that policies related to urban land use planning and energy management should be integrated and quantitatively evaluated over the long-term with the aim of supporting urban low-carbon sustainable development.

AB During winter-time in Mongolia, the air pollution is so severe that it threatens the citizens' health. Ulaanbaatar is the capital city of Mongolia, and its population represents about half of the total population of Mongolia. The majority of people in the Ger area, approximately 50% of population of Ulaanbaatar, rely on direct coal burning to generate the required heat to maintain a comfortable environment in the cold season. The heavy reliance on coal leads to catastrophic air pollutant emissions including carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which leads to global warming, climate change and human health. As it is identified that building insulation retrofit is one of the best ways to reduce the reliance on coal consumption due to the improved heat retention and air tightness, a tool, named "FIXIT" has been developed to quickly quantify the impact from insulation retrofit. This paper presents how "FIXIT" was developed and is applied to help house owners to understand their building performance. Not only can "FIXIT" be applied for individual houses, it can also be used to estimate the reduction of air pollution from coal burning due to insulation retrofit. With "FIXIT", it is estimated that about 530 ktons of carbon emissions reduction can be targeted by applying building insulation retrofit, if around the 100,000 detached houses in Ulaanbaatar apply insulation retrofit. By highlighting the advantages on the building performance, "FIXIT" can encourage more house owners to improve their house insulation quality and thus contribute to the air quality, creating a cleaner and healthier environment and saving on fuel use.

AB This paper presents a geographic information-based mixed integer linear programming model for a district heating system design. The model minimizes the annualized investment and operation costs of the system, with the key results showing the optimal distribution network structure and optimal capacity and dispatch of heat plants. A network topology of nodes and edges, providing accurate geographic representation of the district, is generated using a geographic information system and acts as a constraint. A case study is conducted for a district in Hirosaki city, located in the northernmost prefecture of mainland Japan. The results demonstrate the considerable economic benefits of integrating locally available woodchips in heat-only boilers instead of using city gas due to lower fuel costs. Low temperature operation reduces the fuel costs due to less network heat loss compared to medium temperature operation, but it is overcome by the cost of the larger pipe size and the pumping power. Implementation of the district heating system to the case area encourages sustainable development through economic favorability, decreased primary energy consumption, and considerable CO2 emissions reduction, compared to the current heat supply structure.

AB With the progress in science and technology, many types of electrical equipment have been invented, making the use of electricity more extensive, and living environment more comfortable. However, in modern times, every country stresses the need to promote green energy in order to reduce environmental damage, while the Taiwanese government made an attempt to adjust electricity price as a means to make Taiwan people to reduce carbon emissions and pollution on the planet. Therefore, the paper takes electricity price on the power consumption of Taiwan people as the research object, observes tariff adjustment trends of relevant government departments, and builds Taiwan's average electricity consumption and the average price forecast model to provide references to government and researchers. Firstly, we gather data of electricity consumption and price from Taiwan Power Company's website, and draw a trend chart to explore the relationship between the two; and respectively work out technical indicators of average electric quantity and electricity prices by referring to stock technical indicators; finally, we compare Neural Network parameters optimized by Grey Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (GFOA) to build average power consumption and average electricity price forecasting models, and compare the best prediction model with other three algorithms. The study results demonstrate that the electricity consumption and electricity price trends have different characteristics; it is found out that the prediction model of smoothing parameter sigma of General Regression Neural Network optimized by GFOA has better predictive ability compared to prediction models constructed by other three algorithms.

AB The paper addresses the development of a bottom-up building stock energy model (BuilS) for identification of the building stock renovation potential by considering energy performance of individual buildings through cross-linked data from various public available databases. The model enables integration of various EE and RES measures on the building stock to demonstrate long-term economic and environmental effects of different building stock refurbishment strategies. In the presented case study, the BuilS model was applied in the Ko. cevje city area and validated using the measured energy consumption of the buildings connected to the city district heating system. Three strategies for improving the building stock in Ko. cevje towards a more sustainable one are presented with their impact on energy use and CO2 emission projections up to 2030. It is demonstrated that the BuilS bottom-up model enables the setting of a correct baseline regarding energy use of the existing building stock and that such a model is a powerful tool for design and validation of the building stock renovation strategies. It is also shown that the accuracy of the model depends on available information on local resources and local needs, therefore acceleration of the building stock monitoring on the level of each building and continually upgrading of databases with building renovation information is of the utmost importance.

ID USE ENERGY-CONSUMPTION
AB An assessment of residential CO2 emissions is typically performed through the intensity method, in which total energy consumption is estimated by multiplying floor space by intensity value. Although spatially detailed intensity data is required for an accurate estimation, the finer spatial resolution will result in a less stable estimated value due to the small sample size; hence, existing studies in Japan created intensity data at a regional or prefectural level. The objective of this study is to create municipality level intensity data via a statistical approach, using the household level micro data from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, by focusing on electricity. First, this study builds several (spatial) statistical models, where per household electricity expenditure is regressed on housing types (two categories), household types (seven categories), and other household specific variables. Second, by substituting averaged municipality level explanatory variables from official statistics into the model, it estimates municipality level intensity data. The obtained results suggest that conventional intensity data in Japan, created by the simple average of samples in each unit (prefecture), may suffer from an upward bias, suggesting a danger of overestimation of residential CO2 emissions.

AB Civil buildings in urban areas are one of the main sources of CO2 emissions. Many factors in civil buildings cause CO2 emissions to increase in China's urban areas. Factors that have influenced CO2 emissions from civil buildings in Chinese cities between 1997 and 2007 are studied using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. The following factors influence the increase of CO2 emissions: urban population, per capita floor space, building structure, building energy intensity and carbon emission coefficients. The results show that, between 1997 and 2007, increase in CO2 emissions by civil buildings in China's urban areas was largely driven by the increasing urban population and per capita floor space, which have contributed 56 and 87%, respectively, and present a trend of significant increase. The structural proportion change of areas of residential buildings and public buildings caused less of an impact of CO2 emissions. The reduction in the intensity of energy consumption of buildings is the major factor that could deter the increase in the rate of CO2 emissions, contributing 245%. However, this deterrence is slowing down. While maintaining the speed of urbanization of China, the key measures to suppress the increase in civil building CO2 emissions in urban areas are to reduce the intensity of building energy consumption and to control the per capita floor space.

AB In this study, annual, monthly and hourly ambient temperature distributions are determined and analysed for Karabuk . For each month of the year, variance of outdoor air temperature, monthly and seasonal heating degree hour (HDH) values are calculated according to 11 different indoor reference temperature (18 degrees C to 28 degrees C), and the resulting coefficient of determination indicates high correlation as R-2 = 0.998. By considering HDH values, three kinds of fossil energy resources, (coal, natural gas, fuel-oil), annual unit area fuel needs, amount of carbon-dioxide and sulphur-dioxide. When indoor temperature is chosen 19 degrees C instead of 18 degrees C for coal, annual CO2 emission increases by 8.7%. On the other hand, 24 degrees C indoor temperature, rate of increase reaches to 53.2%. This study is first in the literature to investigate the effect of three kinds of fuel's energy impact on environment in the case of different indoor reference temperature for heating.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Built environment consumes the bulk of the UK's fossil fuel. Schools account for 15% of the public sector's carbon emissions. Energy efficient building design can play a vital role in achieving the national carbon emission reduction target of 80% by 2050. Natural and mixed mode ventilation is at the forefront of suggested energy efficient strategies for reducing carbon emissions from schools while maintaining good indoor air quality and thermal comfort. However, it is challenging to naturally ventilate many urban school buildings through side openings because of high noise and particulate air pollution. An alternative strategy, such as multi floor operation of windcatchers was assessed in this research as a sole source of fresh air in teaching spaces. Dynamic thermal simulation (DTS) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations assessed the performance of the adopted natural ventilation (NV) strategy in meeting the approved requirements for fresh air, indoor air quality (IAQ) and summertime overheating. Simulation results show that it is challenging to meet approved guidelines on air quality and thermal comfort, only when windcatchers are employed for ventilation purpose. However, fan assisted ventilation in conjunction with windcatchers provided satisfactory results. Detailed performance assessments using CFD seem desirable to validate DTS based findings.

AB There is a large potential to reduce primary energy use and CO2 emissions from the Swedish building stock. Here detached houses heated by oil, natural gas or electric boilers were assessed. CO2 emissions, primary energy use and heating costs were evaluated before and after implementing house envelope measures, conversions to more efficient heating systems and changes to biomass fuel use. The study included full energy chains, from natural resources to usable heat in the houses. The aim was to evaluate the societal economic cost effectiveness of reducing CO2 emission and primary energy use by different combinations of changes. The results demonstrated that for a house using an electric boiler, a conversion to a heat pump combined with house envelope measures could be cost efficient from a societal economic perspective. If the electricity was based on biomass, the primary energy use was at the same time reduced by 70% and the CO2 emission by 97%. Large emission reductions were also seen for conversions from oil and gas boilers to a biomass-based system. However, for these conversions the heating cost increased, leading to a mitigation cost of around (sic)50/tonne C avoided. The price of oil and natural gas greatly influenced the competitiveness of the alternatives. House envelope measures were more cost-effective for houses with electric boilers as the cost of energy for this system is high. The results are specific to a Swedish context, but also give an indication of the potential in other regions, such as northern European and large parts of North America, which have both a cold climate and a widespread use of domestic boilers.

AB The advancement of new urbanization policy (NU) and the attainment of double carbon targets play pivotal roles in facilitating high-quality economic development in China. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the mechanism and spatial spillover effects of NU on carbon emission intensity reduction (CEIR), building upon an examination of the nature of NU and the principles of urban carbon pollution control. The research employs a multi-period difference-in-difference model (DID) to explore the causal relationship between NU and CEIR, using panel data from 278 prefecture-level cities spanning the period of 2006 to 2020. Empirical results demonstrate that the implementation of NU resulted in an 8.4 % reduction in carbon emission intensity (CEI). Furthermore, the analysis of the transmission mechanism reveals that NU stimulates green technology innovation and facili-tates the development of industrial agglomeration, thus achieving CEIR. The decomposition of the spatial Durbin model indicates significant spatial spillover effects in the effectiveness of NU, signifying its positive impacts not only within the region but also in generating benefits for surrounding areas. Moreover, the dynamic heterogeneity results indicate that entrepreneurial vitality and urbanization rate exhibit dynamic effects on the policy's CEIR effect, both displaying nonlinear enhancement curves. Based on this, the policy implications of this paper include: The government should enhance regional coordinated governance to address carbon emissions pollution in alignment with China's NU. This can be accomplished by effectively harnessing the driving role of green innovation and industrial agglomeration. Additionally, the local government can actively create an entrepreneurial atmosphere and expedite the urbanization process in order to support NU in the implementation and achievement of CEIR.

If PCMs with low embodied carbon are utilized, emissions associated with building operation can be reduced further (when compared to market-dominating paraffinic PCMs). For these reasons, research has been emerging on bio-based PCMs, such as animal- and/or plant-based oils, fatty acids, or combinations of these, in recent years. This study provides a comprehensive review of the thermophysical properties, building integration techniques, and lifetime impacts of bio-based PCMs, including barriers limiting their usage and potential areas for future research. PCMs of different thicknesses have minimized conditioning loads most in moderate climates, compared to extreme cold or warm regions. The results of this review also show that primary use bio-based PCMs may have similar or greater lifecycle carbon emissions when compared to paraffins; however, recycled, secondary use bio-PCMs may minimize total carbon emissions and is an area that necessitates future research.

AB This paper introduces an exergy-based optimization model for radiant heating or cooling panels coupled with heat pumps for minimum carbon dioxide emissions responsibility. The general idea that there exists an optimum tube spacing in radiant panels for minimum carbon dioxide emission responsibility in terms of simple life-cycle analysis and the first law of thermodynamics is challenged. Using the Rational Exergy Management Model, it is shown that a real optimum is unavailable according to the second law with or without using heat pumps or boilers for temperature peaking or chillers for cooling. It is hypothesized that the use of temperature-adjusting heat pumps is not an exergy-optimum choice. Through twelve sets of optimization constraints, identified in this paper, it is shown that potential optimality conditions concerning the increase of emission embodiments of the radiant panel material and labor with respect to narrover tube spacing versus an increase in the coefficient of performance of the heat pump, thus a decrease in operational emissions, lies outside the feasible design range. This paper also reminds that heat pumps destroy part of the high unit exergy of the electrical power demand by generating only low-exergy thermal energy. It is further shown that delegating solar photo-voltaic panels for thermal and electrical power supply as well as temperature peaking provides optimal solutions both for radiant panel heating and cooling, enabling wide use of low-enthalpy energy sources. Three case studies are presented. Case 1: Hydronic floor heating with temperature-peaking heat pump. This case has the highest emissions responsibility among other cases. It is + 0.095 kg CO2/kW-hexergy of heat delivered per unit panel area. Case 2: Oversized radiant floor heating with closer tube spacing without a heat pump. This case is responsible for + 0.035 kg CO2/kW-hexergy of heat delivered per unit panel area. 3-a: Heat-piped solar photo-voltaic-thermal panels with floor heating with heat pipes. This case has a negative emissions responsibility of -0.010 kg CO2/kW-hexergy of heat delivered. 3-b: This case is the radiant ceiling cooling option of Case 3-a. It is responsible for + 0.0010 kg CO2/kW-hexergy of sensible cooling. Results show that negative-carbon solar heating with radiant panels may be achieved with real roots available for optimum tube spacing. Optimal tube spacings for ceiling cooling panels also exist.

AB As an artificial and natural coupling system, cultivated land effectively link the socio-ecosystem by appearing the mixed outcomes from human's interactions with nature including resource consumption, food security, urban growth, environmental pollution emission, land use change, and developmental policies. However, there still exists many problems that the impacts of human activities on environment are hard to assess and the responsibilities are difficult to allocate when discussing the cultivated land protection, despite the towards constant efforts. This paper tries to construct an eco-account of cultivated land by integrating resources utilization into socio-economic activities, as it indeed provides assistance to practical issues and also is a global trend of environmental-economic accounting. To achieve this, the multi-regional input-output table was used as the important tool that can be considered as the proxy of socio-economic system. The cultivated land is regarded to be embodied and transferred in the economic trade of products and services. We quantify the ecological footprint and ecosystem services flows of cultivated land, build the link between the actual consumption and the physical depletion, and identify the supplier and demander of cultivated land among regions in China. The results show that: 1) The embodied cultivate land in the final consumption presents difference in terms of 31 regions and consumption categories. The developed areas having higher virtual cultivated land consumption and dependence upon others. 2) The north China is mainly the supplier and south is the demander of cultivated land, and the major resources transfer flow is from the north to south and west to east of China. 3) By assessing the eco-value of cultivated land, a revised matrix table containing the account of cultivated land eco-asset transfer for each region is constructed. The framework of this paper can provide aid of assigning responsibilities concerning cultivated land protection and offer a new view to help find a practicable avenue to the eco-compensation or integrated utilization of cultivated land.

ID DEMOLITION WASTE MANAGEMENT; COSTS
AB Construction organisations and governments need to seek a sustainable solution to optimise resource consumption, minimise energy use, and reduce glasshouse gas emissions caused by construction operations as the building stock grows. The circular economy (CE) has become a promising option for these organisations and policymakers in many countries owing to its ability to close material loops throughout the building lifecycle. Despite its importance, the application of CE throughout construction is limited, and its applicability to different aspects of construction remains under-researched. The purpose of this research is to discover all applicable viewpoints on CE in the construction industry that narrow or close material loops. To investigate the development of circularity in construction, a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method was performed by integrating a bibliometric analysis. 78 articles were rigorously selected to conduct the critical content analysis to classify the extant CE literature. This study classified the extant CE literature into eight themes: 1) circular business models; 2) R principles; 3) construction and demolition waste; 4) the economic effect of CE; 5) greenhouse gas emissions; 6) the role of digital technological tools; 7) offsite construction; and 8) life cycle assessment. Based on the critical content analysis, theoretical interrelationships between the themes were identified, along with future research avenues. Findings highlighted the significance of (1) encouraging the use of recycled materials by enhancing economies of scale; (2) the need for regulatory bodies and construction businesses to step in to achieve circularity in construction; (3) the impact of supply chain complexities in minimising carbon emissions; and (4) the necessity of investing in training for the construction industry. Further research is needed to determine the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and the application of digital technologies in order to fully realise the benefits of CE adoption. An allinclusive CE adoption across the entire building life cycle, taking into account diverse perspectives, could contribute to closing the resource loops in construction.

AB The stock of building materials has critical impact on sustainable development and on the reduction of the carbon emissions of the construction industry; however, the accumulated stock of building materials and its carbon emissions remain uncertain. To clarify the stock situation regarding existing buildings in China and provide reference material to support reduction of building-related carbon emissions, the accumulated building material stock and associated carbon emissions were visualized and quantified in this study based on building vector data of 33 cities and nighttime light data. In 2017, 8.8 Gt of building materials in 161.1 billion m3 of accumulated building stock produced emissions of 17.8 Gt CO2eq. Concrete and cement represented the main material types and the greatest sources of emissions. Notable disparities were found in material stock among different regions, determined primarily by factors such as areas of urban and rural construction land, population, GDP, and landform. Spatial visualization of material carbon emission intensity in China revealed a pattern of "higher in the southeast, lower in the north and midland," and showed three aggregation modes. The results of this study could serve as scientific reference for new policies regarding low-carbon building, thereby promoting carbon emission reduction and sustainable utilization of resources in the construction industry.

AB Off-site construction (OSC) methods have captured significant recognition during the last decade due to a range of benefits offered, from reduced construction time and cost to improved efficiency and environmental savings. OSC is proven to have enhanced performance in environmental issues such as waste generation and carbon emissions. However, even with well-documented benefits, by 2018, no major market has yet exceeded 20% of OSC penetration. Thus, identifying factors that advanced and enhanced the environmental performance of OSC from current research to understand the learnings and strategies is timely. A systematic literature review on the role of developed and developing economies in the environmental sustainability of off-site constructed buildings and identifying critical success factors (CSFs) is a novel research opportunity in the current literature. Thus, this research presents a systematic review of the environmental sustainability of OSC (ESOSC) with a clear focus on comparing OSC and its advancements in developed and developing countries. The research methodology involves a bibliometric analysis (BA) followed by an in-depth qualitative discussion. The BA identified key research trends, gaps, and governing countries in ESOSC research. The critical review has significantly focused on comparing the ESOSC studies in developed and developing countries to understand the differences, similarities, CSFs, and future opportunities. The outcomes of BA and critical discussion suggested that further research is required in the following topic areas: comprehensive sustainability assessments, smart/computerized technology integration, prefabrication rate-related research, integration of circular economy/sustainable development goals, and developing region-specific research. The theoretical value of the paper is in facilitating a solid basis for future investigations into the role of these economies in the triple bottom line of sustainability. The practical contribution of the study is to guide OSC stakeholders to increase the rate of OSC adoption and boost environmental performance.

AB Prefabricated buildings are gradually being promoted from pilot demonstration to scale, to combat climate change and improve energy conservation and emission reduction in the building sector. Despite the carbon emission of assembled structures being substantially lower than that of cast-in-place buildings due to the significant reduction in energy demand during the materialization process, there is still a lot of room for improvement. This study looks at the strategy choices made by manufacturers of prefabricated building components in relation to lowering carbon emissions from the standpoint of manufacturing prefabricated building components. By building a dynamic evolutionary game model between two parties, we investigate the evolutionary process of the strategy chosen by prefabricated building component manufacturers and the government, analyzing the evolutionary stability of each side's strategy choice, and finally using Matlab tools to simulate the effectiveness of the evolutionary stability. The study findings indicate that (1) low-carbon production costs, local government incentives and sanctions, and corporate low-carbon production benefits are the main influencing factors for manufacturers of prefabricated building components to adopt low-carbon production techniques; and that (2) the cost of regulation under low-carbon production methods and the local government performance assessment system are the key elements affecting regulations by the local government. Based on this finding, we suggest corresponding countermeasures in three areas, including investigating new low-carbon technology options for businesses, developing a new carbon emission accounting subsidy mechanism, and improving the regulatory framework of the government, to provide an efficient pathway for the growth of a low-carbon economy.

AB The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is a national initiative aimed at building a world-class city cluster in China and whose trends, socioeconomic drivers of CO2 emissions, and mitiga-tion pathways are of great significance to the high-quality regional economic development. This study compiled the CO2 emission inventories of the GBA from 2000 to 2019 and explored the key drivers of CO2 emissions using the logarithmic mean Divisia index method. The results showed that CO2 emissions in GBA slowed significantly after 2017 and have already been decoupled from gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Economic growth and energy intensity are the major factors driving and inhibiting the increase in GBA's CO2 emissions, respectively. The energy production and heavy manufacturing sectors have reduced their roles in driving the growth of GBA's CO2 emissions. GBA achieved remarkable results in low-carbon development through industrial restructuring and upgrading. Industrial upgrades in Shenzhen and Hong Kong and technological advances in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Foshan have signif-icantly curbed the growth in the GBA's CO2 emissions. The heterogeneity of cities in the GBA greatly increases the complexity of formalizing the allocation of emission reduction tasks and developing a road -map for regional carbon neutrality. Graded emission reduction strategies and carbon peaking and neu-trality policy recommendations for GBA cities are proposed. This study provides a scientific basis for the development of an action program for carbon peaking and neutrality in GBA cities and low-carbon development plans for other cities and regions.& COPY; 2022 THE AUTHORS.

AB The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the most densely built and economically vibrant regions in China, it is of vital importance to study the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and influence mechanisms of its carbon emissions against the backdrop of peak-ing carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. However, systematic research on this area is still lacking. Therefore, this study uses spatial autocorrelation, kernel density esti-mation, and standard deviation ellipses to construct an exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) framework to analyze the spatio-temporal evolutionary characteristics of carbon emissions from GBA and combine it with the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model to identify the various influencing factors of carbon emissions in GBA and reveal its implications. The results showed that: (1) Between 2009 and 2019, the total carbon emissions in GBA remained stable and gradually decreased. The gap between the carbon emission intensity of the cities narrowed. (2) The GBA urban agglomeration exhibited spatial autocorrelation, but characteristics of the global spatial pattern had not yet formed a steady state. The kernel density of carbon emissions in GBA showed an obvious "monopolar" phenomenon. (3) The gravity centre of carbon emissions in GBA was located to the southeast of the geometric centre of the whole region, shifting toward the northwest. (4) Population size, level of economic development and energy intensity have a strong positive contribution to carbon emissions, compared to the level of opening up and industrialization level, which has a weaker impact. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of regression coefficients for each factor, and GBA should take full account of the characteristics of different types of cities in terms of carbon emissions and implement targeted emission reduction strategies. Our research provides a comprehensive analytical framework for regional carbon emissions, offering theoretical support for low-carbon development in the GBA.

AB In 2020, the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (SHUROOQ) initiated the Sharjah Sustainable City (SSC) project, with an investment of 2 billion AED (approximately 545 million USD) covering an area of 668,900 km(2). This pioneering residential community in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) provides its residents with access to renewable energy storage solutions while adhering to the highest standards of green economy and environmental sustainability. This paper aims to examine the urban planning components of SSC and establish suitable priorities for these elements. To achieve this, we first reviewed and extracted sustainable urban planning elements from existing research. These elements were then organized hierarchically for an expert survey, which was conducted via email. The results were subsequently analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Our findings revealed that the transportation system sector was deemed most important, with a score of 0.283, followed by the energy/building sectors at 0.263. Conversely, the park/green area held relatively lower importance, with a score of 0.092. Upon examining the relative importance of 15 specific planning elements (lower criteria), energy-efficient building design emerged as the most critical aspect (0.121). Other highly valued elements included public transportation-oriented development (0.115) and the use of renewable energy (0.102). In contrast, building greening (0.029), establishment of accessible greenway and green matrix in residential areas (0.029), and creation of hydrophilic features for the water circulation system (0.026) were perceived as less significant. This study is expected to serve as foundational data for the future implementation of the SSC master plan in Sharjah. Moreover, it offers valuable insights and a methodology for sustainable urban planning that can be adopted or adapted globally. The worldwide applicability of this research fosters knowledge transfer, international cooperation, and innovation, thereby promoting sustainable development, urban resilience, and progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically, SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

AB The energy consumption of the Libyan common house is estimated through the use of simulation namely, the TRNSYS simulation programme and other tools to reach the best solutions with the assumption of changing the behaviours of those buildings occupants into better behaviours that help in energy conservation. Using official data from The Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, the Ministry of Housing and Utility, the Centre for Solar Energy Research and Studies (CSERS), measurements and a survey using a well-designed questionnaire, the relevant information is gathered and the research is conducted. The energy audit of the typical home has been conducted by using the simulation programme 'TRNSYS' and other tools, to identify the role and weight of each source of energy consumption in the energy savings strategy. The study provided a detailed analysis of the thermal and electrical consumption in Libyan houses. The energy audit showed that the total energy consumption was found about 16,500 kWh/year, and it is distributed by sources as 36% by electrical appliances, 24% by lighting the interior space, 15% for water heating, and about 13% for both cooling and heating the space. The estimated specific energy consumption is found as 238.7 kWh/m(2) floor area. As a result, it is found that it is possible to save over 6650 TWh of electrical energy by implementing the proposed strategic plan. These savings will have a positive impact on both the economy and the environment by reducing CO2 emissions from power plants by 6.54 million tonnes of CO2 per year, saving about 1.935 million tons of burning Diesel fuel and saving about $333.54 million as social cost of the CO2.

AB Urbanisation can cause a variety of environmental and health issues, which has prompted experts to evaluate degraded areas and develop management strategies aimed at promoting urban sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. In low-carbon cities, sustainable urban areas have low carbon emission and prioritised carbon reduction by implementing sustainable transportation, green infrastructure, and energy-efficient buildings. On the other hand, unsustainable urban areas tend to lack these priorities and rely heavily on non-renewable energy sources and have high carbon emission. Therefore, this study aims to identify the most sustainable and unsustainable regions in the Abha-Khamis Mushayet Twin City region of Saudi Arabia in respect to urbanisation and carbon emission during the period between 1990 and 2020. To do so, we used Landsat datasets to create land use land cover (LULC) maps and then calculated carbon storage, emission, and absorption using InVest software. Additionally, the study examined micro-climatic conditions by calculating the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which allowed determining sustainable and unsustainable regions by comparing the UHI model and carbon similarity and mismatch model using coupling coordination degree model (CCDM). The study found that during the last three decades, the LULC pattern of the region underwent significant alterations, resulting in a substantial decline in carbon storage from 710,425 Mg C/hm(2) in 1990 to approximately 527,012.9 Mg C/hm(2) in 2020. Conversely, carbon emissions were observed to be very high in areas with high built-up density, with emission levels exceeding 20 tons per annum. Whilst the areas of excess carbon have decreased significantly, the areas of excess carbon emission have increased over time, resulting in the UHI effect due to high greenhouse gases. By comparing the UHI and carbon similarity and mismatch model, the researchers found that over 280 km(2) of the study area is unsustainable and has increased since 1990. In contrast, only about 410 km(2) of the study area is currently sustainable. To promote sustainability, the study recommends several strategies such as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage; green infrastructure; and the use of renewable energy to manage carbon emissions.

AB In this paper, the energy loss of the green building is optimized based on the thickness and lay-up of the Nano-insulation. As different thicknesses and lay-up of the Nano-insulation have a direct effect on energy consumption of the green building with 1590 square meters, especially with nanomaterial, the machine learning models are employed to represent a new model of the thermal conductivity of the proposed advanced insulation with the precision above 99%. The machine learning models are employed to classify and model the behavior of the heat transfer in the green building due to the complex behavior of the thermal conductivity in the green building. Therefore, 110 data for modeling 20 types of lay-up with 6 different thicknesses are prepared by the machine learning models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and decision tree. Based on the data analysis and statistical data, thermal conductivity modeling with a decision tree represents the best performance and fitted model. The multi-Disciplinary Optimizing method (MDO) under energy consumption constraint, economical consideration, and environmental effects on insulation properties is performed to enhance the energy efficiency of the green building. The calculated results with the Degree-Day approach reveal that the amount of energy saving for green buildings with Nano insulation is about 40% higher than common insulation in common types of insulations. The proposed insulation characteristics regarding the value of Present Worth Function (PWF) and economic aspects cause energy saving per unit area and decreasing in CO2 emission between 290 kg/m3 to 293 kg/m3 depending on weather conditions, insulation thickness, and lay-up.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB The frequent occurrence of extremely high temperatures and heatwaves (HWs), combined with the urban heat island (UHI) effect, significantly affects building energy consumption. This study is performed to investigate the impacts of UHI on building cooling demand during HW periods in megacities. Thus, we examine a typical HW event in late June and early July of 2018, which is classified into HW and non-HW periods, in the two megacities of Beijing and Tianjin. Based on hourly meteorological observation data and rural weather stations selected using satellite-based methodology, the impacts of the UHI on the hourly cooling loads of typical residential and office buildings are evaluated by simulating the hourly cooling loads during the HW event. The results show that the hourly maximum urban heat island intensity (UHII) in Beijing and Tianjin reached 8.4 degrees C and 5.7 degrees C during the HW period, respectively. The cooling load of the buildings as well as the urban-rural load difference increased significantly when HWs occurred. The urban-rural hourly load difference of the office buildings is greater than that of the residential buildings. During nighttime, the urban-rural hourly load difference of the residential buildings increased, and the peak value occurred between 02:00 LST and 04:00 LST, which is more evident in Beijing than in Tianjin. For every 1 degrees C increase in the UHII, the hourly cooling load of the residential buildings (office buildings) in the urban areas increased by 0.5 x 10-3 kWh/m2 (1.4 x 10-3 kWh/m2) compared with that in the rural areas. These findings should be considered in the building design and operation regulation of energy saving, particularly the impacts of extreme HWs and UHI on peak loads, to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions in other megacities located at similar latitudes and with similar conditions as those of Beijing and Tianjin.

AB Models have long been effective tools in the planning and policy making of energy systems, but lowcarbon electrification-decarbonizing generation supply while expanding electrical demand-poses new challenges for the modeling community. At its core, electrification relies on integrating insights that span the supply and demand side of power systems, resolving operational characteristics and longterm climate change, and the integration of previously independent engineered systems. However, our modeling landscape consists of a suite of models that focus on distinct sectors (power, buildings, transport) and spatial-temporal scales (municipal, provincial, federal). This paper probes whether the existing suite of energy system models, which span sectors, disciplines, and jurisdictions, is up to the task of charting net-zero pathways, specifically in the Canadian context. To do so, we analyze an inventory of energy system models that are being used in practice using a recently assembled model database. Next, we supplement our analysis with a web-based search and literature review. For each model category, we describe the key modeling approaches, strengths and weaknesses, and typical ways and areas in which these models are applied. We find that by focusing on a specific scale and sector, these models by their very definition, omit out-of-scope interactions leaving critical information gaps. Many of the most imperative areas for future research straddle multiple sectors or multiple scales-electric vehicle charging, carbon policy coordination, regional electricity trading, to name a few. Future research should focus on identifying ways in which different models could be used together to produce policy-related conclusions that are as detailed but more holistic than conclusions that can be gleaned from an individual model.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Coal production and consumption cause methane and carbon dioxide emissions. The high emission cost and the limited renewable energy in some areas restrict the low-carbon energy system development. This paper proposes a double recovery system based on a multi-energy system to promote energy efficiency and emission reduction, considering the life cycle carbon emissions of coal and carbon trading. A nonlinear multi-objective two-stage stochastic programming model and an approximate solution algorithm based on NSGA-II are built to find the economic-ecological balanced strategy for the system investment and operation under uncertainty. Finally, a case study about the collieries in Xianyang City is adopted to test the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The results show the multi-energy system with a double recovery system can obtain 5%-40% more profits compared with the single energy system when the GHG emission rate requirement is lower than 0.95kgCO2e/kwh. And this paper finds that carbon capture and storage has more universal utility in obtaining tradable green certificates, and the efficiency of P2G technology depends on the abundance of renewable energy. The tradable green certificates are effective incentives for coal mine methane utilization.

   ANALYSIS
AB Hydrogen (H2), more than a promising solution, has been considered one of the pillars to reduce CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2-eqv) in hard-to-abate sectors like transportation, petrochemical, steel, and cement. The feed-stocks, the greenness of the energy consumed, the synthesis pathway, and the mitigation strategies used during its synthesis will be determinant to reduce its environmental footprint. In 2021, the production of H2 reached 900 x 105 t; 60% of this production was synthetized from natural gas through reforming processes, which consumed 205 x 109 m3 of natural gas and 110 x 107 m3 of H2O, and generated 556 x 106 t CO2 and profits for 118 billion US dollars. In 2050, the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario projected by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the energy sector will demand 530 x 106 t H2; 60% of this demand will be satisfied by elec-trolytic processes launched by green energy sources (wind, solar, hydro, and biomass) and the rest by reforming processes that use environmental mitigation technologies, like carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS). The latter suggests that the non-renewable methane (CH4), the biomethane (bio-CH4), and biomass gasification processes will be key to lead the gradual decarbonizing of the economy. This work depicts the current status of mature and emerging reforming technologies to produce H2 and focuses on the environmental implications of H2 production from feedstocks like gas and biogas.

AB The residential building sector contributes significantly to energy use in Australia. However, future energy use in residential buildings is seldom evaluated from a life cycle perspective, and such analysis rarely provides details about potential energy savings by specific strategies. This study develops a scenario-based bottom-up approach to predict the future life cycle energy (LCE) trajectories in residential buildings to 2050 with different energy -saving strategies. The proposed approach is used to investigate the impacts of strategies on the future LCE of residential buildings in detail in four scenarios: high carbon (HC), business-as-usual (BAU), accelerated policy (AP), and net-zero emissions (NZE), for a case study of Inner Melbourne Cities. The results demonstrate the potential upward trajectory of operational energy (OE) in the HC scenario and a downward trend in the NZE scenario. The analysis also reveals how stringent energy-efficient strategies and increasing renewable energy supply could lead to future net-zero operational emissions in the NZE scenario by 2050. The most effective strategies for decarbonising the residential building sector include improving the building envelope efficiency, upgrading heating and hot water systems, and using renewable energy. Furthermore, embodied energy (EE) will contribute more to LCE after 2045 in AP and NZE scenarios with the decrease of OE. EE in the NZE scenario is higher than that in the other three scenarios, as energy-efficient dwellings usually use more insulation materials. Therefore, EE reduction is critical for achieving net-zero life cycle emissions in the residential building sector. Building stakeholders should synergistically promote demand-side, supply-side, and EE reduction strategies for achieving net-zero life cycle emissions. A detailed analysis of the future LCE development with different stra-tegies shows the benefits of the proposed approach, which supports informed decision-making towards the 2050 net-zero emissions target.

AB The scale and pace of energy infrastructure development required to achieve netzero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are unprecedented, yet our understanding of how to minimize its potential impacts on land and ocean use and natural resources is inadequate. Using high-resolution energy and land-use modeling, we developed spatially explicit scenarios for reaching an economy-wide net-zero GHG target in the western United States by 2050. We found that among net-zero policy cases that vary the rate of transportation and building electrification and use of fossil fuels, nuclear generation, and biomass, the "High Electrification" case, which utilizes electricity generation the most efficiently, had the lowest total land and ocean area requirements (84,000 to 105,000 km(2) vs. 88,100 to 158,000 km(2) across all other cases). Different levels of land and ocean use protections were applied to determine their effect on siting, environmental and social impacts, and energy costs. Meeting the net-zero target with stronger land and ocean use protections did not significantly alter the share of different energy generation technologies and only increased system costs by 3%, but decreased additional interstate transmission capacity by 20%. Yet, failure to avoid development in areas with high conservation value is likely to result in substantial habitat loss.

AB Industrial parks, distributed widely and with high energy consumption, show the demand for and provide favorable conditions of application of photovoltaic(PV) systems in a large-scale. Innovative PV technology allows more building integration options, bringing new opportunities for energy conservation.In the study, an evalu-ation framework was constructed in order to evaluate the expansion potential of PV systems. Taking the green integrated energy park in North China as an example, the construction and energy supply-demand data were reviewed.The scalable area of PV, the application effect of varied PV technologies and the impact on pollutant emission reduction were quantitatively analyzed. The roofs, facades and sites in the park were divided into seven types, These are then simulated to deploy mono c-Si modules, poly c-Si modules, CdTe film modules and CIGS film modules to obtain the best solutions by comparison. The results shows that the PV expansion of the park has significantly increased the power generation. The proportion of the energy supply meeting the overall energy demand increased from 4.3 % to 25.9 %. The wall of the production area where CdTe standard film modules were deployed is the place with the highest PV potential, followed by the parking shed and other sites. The deployment of diverse PV modules controlled the economic cost. The power generation trend also would better matches the hourly load of the park's power consumption, which can cover the sub item power consumption of the park. After the PV expansion, CO2 emissions would be reduced by 4757.8 t per year. Based on the results, the correlation change characteristics and the influences of PV available area, PV capacity and power generation index are discussed. Considering the declining PV cost and the demonstrative nature of the case Park, the above results can guide the industrial parks to improve the utilization level of renewable energy and promote the realization of carbon emission reduction targets.

AB The necessary path towards sustainable development makes increasingly crucial the role of energy storage systems because the most affordable renewable energy sources (RES) are typically intermittent In this perspective compressed air energy storage (CAES) is one of the main alternatives to batteries and pumped hydro energy storage. This study shows how an integrated system coupling RES and CAES may significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions with acceptable payback times. The electrical load is provided by a representative building sample (RBS) located in Naples (Southern Italy), generated using the simulation-based large-scale uncertainty/sensitivity analysis of building energy performance (SLABE) methodology. A Pareto multi-objective optimization is performed via a brute-force search to minimize CO2-eq emissions and payback time. The design variables refer to a photovoltaic system design and to size and operation of an associated diabatic CAES. Two different application scenarios are envisaged: 1000 buildings and 2000 buildings. The avoided greenhouse gas emissions are about 55% and 51% with simple payback times of 14.3 years and 12.4 years, respectively. The results show that the proposed integrated framework, with the right mix of renewables, may lead to the complete satisfaction of the electrical load at reasonable costs. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; TOOL
AB According to the 2021 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction published by the United Nations Environment Programme, global carbon emissions from the building sector in 2019 were nearly 14 gigatons (Gt), representing 38% of total global carbon emissions, including 10% from building construction. In the United States, the largest knowledge gap regarding embodied carbon in buildings exists at the whole-building level. The first step in creating informative policy to reduce embodied carbon emissions is to map the existing building stock emissions and changes over time to understand the primary contributing building types and hot spots (states), and then to compare and analyze mitigation scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap, this study first developed a bottom-up model to assess the embodied carbon of the US residential building stock by using 64 archetypes to represent the building stock. Then, the embodied carbon characteristics of the current building stock were analyzed, revealing that the primary contributor was single-family detached (SD) houses. The results indicated that the exterior wall was a major contributor, and that small multifamily housing was the most embodied carbon-intense building type. Two scenarios, the baseline scenario and progressive scenario, were formed to evaluate the effectiveness of six mitigation strategies. The progressive scenario with all mitigation strategies (M1-M6) applied produced a total reduction of 33.13 Gt CO2eq (42%) in the cumulative residential building stock related to carbon emissions during 2022-2050, and a total reduction of 88.34 Gt CO2eq (80%) during 2022-2100. The results show that with an embodied carbon emissions reduction in the progressive scenario (42% by 2100), the total embodied carbon emissions comply with the carbon budget of a 2 degrees C pathway, but will exceed the budget for a 1.5 degrees C pathway.

AB The low-carbon energy transition requires a widespread change in global energy infrastructures which in turn calls for important inputs of energy and materials. While the transport and electricity sectors have been thoroughly analyzed in this regard, that of the hydrocarbon industry has not received the same attention, maybe in part due to the difficulty of access to the necessary data. To fill this gap, we assemble public-domain data from a wide variety of sources to present a stock-flow dynamic model of the fossil fuels supply chain. It is conducted from 1950 to 2050 and along scenarios from the International Energy Agency. We estimate the concrete, steel, aluminum and copper requirements for each segment, as well as the embedded energy and CO2 emissions through a dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) model. We find that (i) the material intensities of oil, gas and coal supply chains have stagnated for more than 30 years; (ii) gas is the main driver of current and future material consumption; and (iii) recycled steel from decommissioned fossil fuels infrastructures could meet the cumulative need of future low-carbon technologies and reduce its energy and environmental toll. Furthermore, we highlight that regional decommissioning strategies significantly affect the potential of material recycling and reuse. In this context, ambitious decommissioning strategies could drive a symbolic move to build future renewable technologies from past fossil fuel structures.

AB CO2 is the most emitted greenhouse gas and is mainly produced by human activity. In fact, about 75% is emitted in cities and 40% of global carbon emissions is produced by the building sector. Therefore, buildings are very important in terms of CO2 emissions. This importance is also reflected in the works that have been developed on this subject. This manuscript reviews the research that has shown or calculated the amounts of CO2 emitted in buildings. For a better understanding of the scope of the investigations, a classification is presented. With this, it is intended to help researchers interested in this area by summarizing the studies carried out to date on the amounts of CO2 emitted depending on the type of building.

AB In order to investigate the impact of green energy technology on the environmental sustainability of China, take the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as an example, this paper first calculates the per capita ecological footprint (ef), ecological carrying capacity (ec) and ecological deficit (ed) of China and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 1990 to 2019 by using the ecological footprint (EF) model, and then uses an expanded STIRPAT model and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to explore the impact and importance of green energy technology on EF in China and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. It is found that the ec of China and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is much lower than that of the ef from 1990 to 2019. It is always in the state of ecological deficit, and the sustainable development is faced with severe challenges. Progress in green energy technology can significantly reduce the EF of China and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The importance of each factor on the EF of China and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is different. The degree of dependence on foreign trade and urbanization rate are important influencing factors of Beijing's EF. Urbanization rate, per capita GDP, population size, energy consumption per unit GDP and built-up area are the important influencing factors of EF in Tianjin and Hebei. Therefore, to reduce the EF of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, it is necessary to accelerate the progress of green energy technology, develop compact ecological city and change people's consumption patterns.

AB Even though the milder climate scenario and constant evolution of thermal building regulation are in light of European initiatives, in Portugal, there are few houses where occupants can remain all the time in perfectly comfortable temperature conditions without resorting to heating or cooling. According to the Long Term Strategy for the Renewal of Buildings (ELPRE), this results from the combination of several factors, namely, low energy use for air conditioning compared to energy needs and aged building stock with poor energy performance. In fact, around 70% of the dwellings currently certified have low energy efficiency (C or less). The purpose of this review article was to analyse and discuss the factors affecting indoor thermal comfort, the inability to keep the home adequately warm in winter and cool in summer, and the risk of poverty or social exclusion in the European context, namely in Portugal. It fills the gap in the literature researching and analysing the motivations for these lower consumptions in Southern Europe, being Portugal a paradigmatic case. The current work integrates the indoor thermal comfort evolution and the current situation in Portugal in the EU context through different thermal comfort indicators and linking with the other statistics data, which may impact the indoor thermal comfort.

AB Buildings and construction are responsible for about 40% of the energy and process-related CO2 emissions worldwide. At present, the renewal rate of building stock is relatively low, for example in Finland, which is the case under study in this work, it is 1.5% per year. With respect to the target of a carbon neutral world by 2050, the effect on emissions of existing building stock must be considered. In this paper, we present the results of analysis of energy efficiency improvement investment in 12 city-owned buildings in two Finnish cities. Using measured heat and electrical energy consumption data, a model was developed for analyzing the impact of active and passive energy efficiency improvement investment options per building. The examined active technologies were heat pumps, solar photovoltaic panels, and heat recovery in ventilation system, and the passive improvement compared was structural improvements in the building envelope. The results show that investments in energy efficiency improvements can reduce the yearly energy-related operating costs of the buildings by 35% on average. The study further finds that usually investment in active energy efficiency improvements provides a bigger return on investment than passive improvements. The profitability of examined measures makes Public-Private Partnership a feasible way to provide funding for renovation of public buildings.

ID HEAT; DEMAND; CONSUMPTION; PROFILES
AB Energy consumption in buildings accounts for more than a third of European CO2 emissions. The existing building stock shows the most potential for energy savings but at the expense of costly renovations. Thus, public intervention is decisive in driving transformation in this sector. However, policymakers mostly rely on heat estimates to develop energy-saving policies, limiting the possibility of aligning renovation support policy with environmental gain, slowing down the decarbonization effort. This study explores the benefits of using metered heat demand data with detailed building archetypes for impactful renovation subsidy allocation. We quantify the missed CO2 emissions due to inaccuracies in heat demand estimates and develop an optimization model to quantify the impact of such inaccuracies on subsidy allocation. For the case study of Lyngby-Taarbaek municipality in Denmark, we find systematic bias in heat demand estimates that attribute higher heat demand to older houses than reality and inversely to newer family houses. Such bias results in the misallocation of 39% of total CO2 emissions and distortion of 40% of the total subsidy. Ultimately, our results help policymakers identify buildings that should be prioritized for a maximum decarbonization impact.

AB As growth regions evolve to accommodate the increasing population, they need to develop a wider variety of residential properties to accommodate the varying needs of the residents. As a result, the new accommodation is denser which involves higher embodied water carbon and energy. This research compares the construction differences in metropolitan and growth regions of Melbourne to identify embodied carbon, water, and energy. Representative areas of 25 km(2) are selected from both regions. The growth region has 80% of the built area comprised of 2nd generation low-rise residential buildings whereas the prolific construction type in the Metropolitan region is mixed purpose industrial with 30% of the built area comprising of this type. The methodology implies open-source satellite imagery to build a spatial dataset in QGIS. The visual identification of the constructions in the study areas enables to identity the materials used in their construction. The total embodied carbon, water, and energy for the Metropolitan region are 32,895 tonnes, 4192 mL, and 3,694,412 GJ, respectively, whereas in the growth region, the totals are 179,376 tonnes carbon, 2533 mL water, and 2,243,571 GJ. Whilst Metropolitan has a significantly higher overall footprint when this is compared to the population of each region, it is shown that the growth region with its current construction type has a higher embodied carbon, water, and energy per head. The total per head for Metropolitan is 226.7 GJ energy, 257 kL water, and 20 tonnes carbon, whereas in the growth region, the embodied energy, water, and carbon, respectively, per head is 287.4 GJ, 324.6 kL, and 22 tonnes. The current performance per head of the growth region is considerably lower than that of Metropolitan. Using diverse residential construction types and efficient materials can serve the demanding needs of denser populated areas.

AB This study represents the first detailed analysis of multi-year, near-surface turbulence observations for an urban area located in highly complex terrain. Using 4 years of eddy covariance measurements over the Alpine city of Innsbruck, Austria, the effects of the urban surface, orographic setting and mountain weather on energy and mass exchange are investigated. In terms of surface controls, the findings for Innsbruck are in accordance with previous studies at city centre sites. The available energy is partitioned mainly into net storage heat flux and sensible heat flux (each comprising about 40 % of the net radiation, Q* , during the daytime in summer) The latent heat flux is small by comparison (only about 10% of Q*) due to the small amount of vegetation present but increases for short periods (6-12 h) following rainfall. Additional energy supplied by anthropogenic activities and heat released from the large thermal mass of the urban surface helps to support positive sensible heat fluxes in the city all year round. Annual observed CO2 fluxes (5.1 kg C M-2 yr(-1)) correspond well to modelled emissions and expectations based on findings at other sites with a similar proportion of vegetation. The net CO2 exchange is dominated by anthropogenic emissions from traffic in summer and building heating in winter. In contrast to previous urban observational studies, the effect of the orography is examined here. Innsbruck's location in a steep-sided valley results in marked diurnal and seasonal patterns in flow conditions. A typical valley wind circulation is observed (in the absence of strong synoptic forcing) with moderate up-valley winds during daytime, weaker down-valley winds at night (and in winter) and near-zero wind speeds around the times of the twice-daily wind reversal. Due to Innsbruck's location north of the main Alpine crest, southerly foehn events frequently have a marked effect on temperature, wind speed, turbulence and pollutant concentration. Warm, dry foehn air advected over the surface can lead to negative sensible heat fluxes both inside and outside the city. Increased wind speeds and intense mixing during foehn (turbulent kinetic energy often exceeds 5 m(2) s(-2)) help to ventilate the city, illustrated here by low CO2 mixing ratios. Radiative exchange is also affected by the orography - incoming shortwave radiation is blocked by the terrain at low solar elevation. The interpretation of the dataset is complicated by distinct temporal patterns in flow conditions and the combined influences of the urban environment, terrain and atmospheric conditions. The analysis presented here reveals how Innsbruck's mountainous setting impacts the near-surface conditions in multiple ways, highlighting the similarities with previous studies in much flatter terrain and examining the differences in order to begin to understand interactions between urban and orographic processes.

AB The international Paris agreement climate goals regarding the residential building sector were mainly incorporated into national legislation as CO2 emission reduction levels for specific years (e.g., 80% CO2 emission reduction until 2035). Financial subsidy schemes incentivizing early retrofitting can lead to lock-in effects, not realizing energy savings potential from technological advancements in the long run and potentially failing emission reduction goals. However, early retrofitting leads to CO2 emission reductions over longer periods, minimizing the combined total CO2 emissions. Depending on which of these two conflicting goals is pursued, differing subsidy schemes are suitable to incentivize respective retrofits. Knowledge about the effects of these subsidy schemes is relevant to setting correct incentives. We, therefore, investigate the difference in CO2 emission reductions of time-dependent subsidy schemes per monetary unit invested. In doing so, this study is the first to investigate time-dependent subsidy schemes. We apply an agent-based building stock model for a case study to the German residential building stock using an extensive real-world dataset. Results indicate that prioritizing early retrofits reduces the probability of achieving emission reduction goals while simultaneously minimizing total CO2 emissions. Total CO2 emission reductions per monetary unit invested differ up to 675% compared to static subsidy schemes. We conclude that political incentive mechanisms should not be designed to meet the climate goals but instead minimize total CO2 emissions.

AB & nbsp;This research assesses the energy performance and environmental damages of a high thermal perfor-mance building envelope (HTPBE) designed for cold-climate regions compared to the conventional stud wall (baseline) using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. Four types of wall assemblies with two dif-ferent thermal resistance (R-values 17 and 50) are assessed and compared with the baseline with R-value 17. The declared unit of the LCA study is the envelope walls used in the conditioned area of a two-storey building in Calgary, Canada. HTPBE walls analyzed in this work include Double stud walls, Structural Insulated Panels (SIP), and Insulated Concrete Form (ICF). Results show that using R-50 HTPBE can decrease about 85 % of the HVAC energy consumption, which brings 80% natural gas saving compared to the baseline. The analysis also shows that CO2 emissions for Double-Stud Wall (DSW) range between 5438 and 10014 kg CO2 eq at the product stage. These values range 9492 and 47618 kg CO2 eq for Structural Insulated Panels (SIP) that may use different insulations (expanded polystyrene-EPS-and extruded polystyrene-XPS). Also, the CO2 emissions of ICF are between 9200 and 22600 kg CO2 eq at the product stage. Comparing the kg CO2 emissions of scenarios to their weights shows that ICF R-17 and R-50 have the lowest CO2 emissions compared with other R-17 and R-50 scenarios. Other environ-mental damages of the scenarios are also discussed in the research. The balance of CO2 emissions and the mitigated CO2 emissions caused by the saved energy in R-50 HTPBEs shows that they are reliable options to be implemented in cold climates.

   ATES systems; Individual ATES system performance; Optimal utilisation of

ID HEAT-TRANSPORT; SIMULATION; EFFICIENCY; PYTHON
AB Low temperature (< 25 ?degrees C) Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems have a world-wide potential to provide low-carbon space heating and cooling for buildings by using heat pumps combined with the seasonal subsurface storage and recovery of heated and cooled groundwater. ATES systems increasingly utilize aquifer space, decreasing the overall primary energy use for heating and cooling for an urban area. However, subsurface interaction may negatively affect the energy performance of individual buildings with existing ATES systems. In this study, it is investigated how aquifer utilization levels, obtained by varying well placement policies, affect subsurface interaction between ATES systems and how this in turn affects individual primary energy use. To this end, a building climate installation model is developed and integrated with a MODFLOW-MT3DMS thermal groundwater model. For the spatial distribution and thermal requirements of 26 unique buildings as present in the city centre of Utrecht, the placement of ATES wells is varied using an agent-based modelling approach applying dense and spacious placement restrictions. Within these simulations ATES adoption order and well placement location is randomized. Well placement density is varied for 9 scenarios by changing the distance between wells of the same and the opposite type. The results of this study show that the applied dense well placement policies lead to a 30% increase of ATES adoption and hence overall GHG emission reduction improved with maximum 60% compared to conventional heating and cooling. The primary energy use of individual ATES systems is affected at varying well placement policies by two mechanisms. Firstly, at denser well placement, ATES systems are able to place more wells, which increases the capacity of their ATES system, thereby decreasing their electricity and gas use. Secondly, aquifer utilization increases with denser well placement policies and thus interaction between individual ATES increases. At subsurface utilization up to 80%, individual primary energy use does not change significantly due to subsurface interaction. At aquifer utilization level > 80%, both negative and positive interaction is observed. Negative interaction between wells of the opposite type leads to an increase of gas or electricity use up to 15% compared to spacious well placement. On the other side, buildings may experience a maximum decrease of 15% electricity use at dense well placement due to positive interaction between wells of the same type. Local conditions like building location, plot size, distance to other buildings and heating/cooling demand determine the specific effect per building. The optimal well placement policy result from the aquifer utilisation levels discussed above. Maximum GHG emission reduction while maintaining individual ATES system performance, is achieved with well distances of 0.5-1 times the yearly average thermal radius for wells of the same type (cold-cold and warm-warm). Opposite well types (cold-warm) should be placed apart similar to 2 times the thermal radius to prevent negative subsurface interaction.

AB There is an urgent need to understand the fishing sector, given the uncertainties and the importance it has gained due to the potential of Algerian waters. The main objective of this paper is to establish a diagnosis of the demand for fishery resources at Algiers fishing ports and provide additional information regarding energy use at a reduced scale. According to the estimated ecological footprint (EF) of fishery production (EFf), Algiers fishing is in the status of ecological surplus, as the demand for fisheries production averages 15,338.49 gha compared to more than 108 thousand gha of biologically productive fishing area. In addition to this overall output, this metric indicates each species' primary production requirement (PPR), which could help to restructure the fishing effort based on the stock's condition. For the energy component, the fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions expressed in metric tons of CO2 were used to estimate the required area for carbon sequestration, valued roughly at 500 gha. The latter is a reference state and remains approximate because it was derived from unofficial data provided by the fishers. This study demonstrated that EF is informative and could be used for resources management. However, it must be built on precise data and supported by further analysis.

AB In response to extreme climate change, China has set a goal of reaching emission peak by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Energy conservation and emission reduction of building heating in northern China are key to achieving this goal. Based on building area prediction and energy consumption intensity, this paper establishes a model for calculating heating energy consumption and carbon emissions in northern residential buildings at the macro level, which provides a basis for formulating policies related to heating and emission reduction in northern buildings. Based on the research method of scenario projection, combining the carbon emission subsets and future heating energy mix projections in northern China, the heating energy consumption in northern China decreases to 175, 149 and 135 Mtce in 2050 under the baseline, medium control and strict control scenarios, respectively. The heating energy consumption in the northern region should be controlled at least under the medium control scheme. Under this scenario, building heating carbon emissions in the north could be reduced to 450 MtCO(2) by 2050, or 280 MtCO(2) if more stringent abatement technologies are adopted. In order to achieve this goal, a combination of energy-saving technologies must be used. The use of biomass and solar technologies should be emphasized in rural heating, while envelope renovation makes the greatest contribution to heating energy savings, with envelope renovation contributing up to 92 Mtce to urban heating.

ID SOCIAL COST
AB We measure the comprehensive carbon price from 2008 to 2019 resulting from climate policies imposed by 25 high-polluting countries that represent 82 percent of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2019. Comprehensive carbon prices build upon previous notions-including explicit, effective, and implicit carbon prices-by incorporating a broad range of policies that reduce carbon emissions. We consider seven types of major market-based policies commonly used to create marginal incentives to reduce emissions: carbon taxes, emissions trading systems, fossil fuel taxes, fossil fuel subsidies, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs, and low-carbon fuel standards. Comprehensive carbon prices represent the weighted average of marginal incentives imposed on polluters by country policy mixes. We measure country-level comprehensive carbon prices by summing across all seven policies the product of (1) the marginal incentive imposed by a policy (expressed in dollars per ton of CO2 emitted), and (2) a CO2-emissions-coverage weight for that policy (equal to the proportion of CO2 emissions regulated by the policy relative to that country's total CO2 emissions). We measure the global comprehensive carbon price by summing across all 25 countries the product of (1) each country's comprehensive carbon price, and (2) that country's proportion of CO2 emissions relative to total CO2 emissions from our sample of 25 countries. The global comprehensive carbon price has risen upward from +8.68 USD in 2008 to +19.13 USD in 2019, with a dip to +6.94 USD per ton in 2012. These values are far too low to appropriately address climate change. The comprehensive carbon price varies widely between countries, ranging from -128.35 USD to +146.25 USD in 2019. This heterogeneity means that polluters face uneven marginal incentives to reduce CO2 emissions. Our focus is on measuring marginal incentives rather than policy outcomes, such as overall emissions abatement, which we identify as a promising area for future research. KEY POLICY INSIGHTS Comprehensive carbon prices represent a useful metric for summarizing and tracking global and country-level efforts to mitigate carbon emissions through public policy. Comprehensive carbon prices report a dollar per ton of carbon dioxide emissions imposed by a wide range of climate policies including carbon taxes, emissions trading systems, fossil fuel subsidies and taxes, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs, and low-carbon fuel standards. Country-level comprehensive carbon prices vary widely, from -128.35 to +146.25 USD in 2019, reflecting wide heterogeneity in the overall effort countries are putting into climate mitigation. The global comprehensive carbon price has approximately doubled over the last decade, reaching a value of +19.13 USD in 2019, and remains too low to seriously address climate change.

AB With the rapid development of China, urbanization has become an important research topic of China's CO2 emissions. To fill the gap in considering the spatial correlation of the comprehensive urbanization that includes multi-dimensional factors on CO2 emissions from urban civil buildings (UBEC), this study constructs a comprehensive evaluation indicator of urbanization from four aspects including population, economy, society, and land urbanization by using the entropy method. The spatial spillover effect of UBEC and the impact of comprehensive urbanization on UBEC are also studied by using the spatial panel model in this paper. This study finds out that UBEC has obvious spatial spillover effects. During the early years of the study period, the eastern coastal areas had greater carbon emissions, while in recent years, they have gradually transitioned to the northwestern regions. Comprehensive urbanization has a significant promotion effect on it. And foreign direct investment and per capita energy consumption also have positive impact on UBEC. This study provides a reference for measuring the effects of urbanization on sector-specific CO2 emissions and may be useful for energy efficiency and emission abatement efforts in China.

AB Buildings consume around 40% of energy and emit 36% of CO2 emissions and, as the largest single energy consumer in Europe, offer the opportunity for significant savings. Building energy labels, also known as Energy Performance Certificates, are a method of providing home buyers with information about the estimated energy consumption of a particular home, enabling them to make more informed decisions in the property market and hopefully encouraging the construction of more energy-efficient homes because of the extra premiums they should charge. There is imperfect information available on the cost-saving effects of efficiency improvements, and the aim of this paper is to examine the role of current building energy labels and the effects of framing this information in terms of its monetary impact on energy bills by conducting a discrete choice experiment. The modelling results show that when monetary estimates are included as part of Energy Performance Certificates, the willingness to pay for higher levels of building energy performance increases by 47%. These results suggest that the inclusion of such monetary information has the potential to increase the value that consumers attach to more energy-efficient homes, thereby creating an incentive to either build better energy-efficient homes or retrofit current housing stock to increase its value.

AB The global agenda recognizes the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for sustainable long-term development. In this regard, the strategic priorities of many countries in the field of energy are focused on renewable energy sources. At the current stage of development, the technological transition to renewable and clean energy requires the search for compromise solutions in the field of economic policy, including an understanding of the role of tax regulation. This paper examines how the use of renewable energy sources impacts the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), considering the domestic extraction of primary resources and innovative activity. Attention is also paid to the role of tax policy in the effectiveness of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The panel data of OECD countries (1991-2018) was analyzed, and the non-stationarity and the cross-correlation across countries were demonstrated, as well as the presence of time series cointegration. The above requires the use of modern techniques in order to build CS-ARDL models (cross-section augmented autoregressive distributed lag modeling) to reliably estimate the short-term and long-term impact of the factors. These results support the hypothesis of the good contribution of renewable energy to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as demonstrate its long-term positive impact. At the same time, a significant contribution is found in countries with stricter tax policies in the field of environmental protection. The obtained results are discussed in the conclusion section, and so are some recommendations for Russian economic policy. The present work may be useful within the scope of establishing research consensus in the area under consideration, and also prove to be of some methodological interest.

AB Space heating is the single greatest source of building-related greenhouse gas emissions in the industrialized world, giving urgency to the development of strategies for carbon-free heating. Recent advances have shown that the direct capture, storage, and deployment of solar energy, without conversion to electricity, has considerable potential to address space-heating needs even in cold and cloudy climates. However, the solar energy available for direct heating at climatic and metropolitan scales is both unquantified and widely assumed to be negligible, impeding further investigation, development, and policy responses. To estimate the magnitude and distribution of solar resources concurrent with space-heating needs, we spatially integrate datasets characterizing solar radiation, outdoor temperature, and heating energy use across U.S. climates. Results show that the median resource incident upon collectors of residential scale (10 m(2)) and distribution is much greater than previously realized, equaling 7 MWh per household annually; by comparison, the median household heating need is currently 10.3 MWh. Unexpectedly, cloud-diffused solar radiation accounts for over one-quarter of this resource in all but semi-arid climates. Metropolitan residential resources exceed 5 TWh in areas including Detroit and Boston (cold continental), Washington D.C. (humid subtropical), Seattle and San Francisco (Mediterranean), and Denver (semi-arid), and national resources exceed 750 TWh annually, compared to approximately 1200 TWh of annual heating need. Current technology is able to capture and retain over half of a direct solar heating resource, revealing that the untapped U.S. solar heating potential is comparable to one-third of the national residential space-heating need and implying that analogous resources exist in analogous climates worldwide.

AB Cooling demand increases more than ten times over the past two decades in China. Especially, cooling in the Hot Summer and Cold Winter (HSCW) climate zone increases rapidly and becomes the fastest growing part in urban residential energy consumption. It will bring huge challenges to carbon emission cap control if effective and reasonable energy-saving and emission reduction measures are not taken. This study uses a data-driven method to identify cooling savings potential at household level using survey data from 1068 households in 2018 in Chongqing, China. A stochastic frontier analysis model is applied to decompose the actual cooling electricity consumption into minimum consumption based on fixed household characteristics and estimate the over-consumption (i.e. the amount of cooling consumption that could be saved). The results show that households have an average cooling efficiency of 65 %, which indicates that each household in the HSCW area has the potential to reduce its cooling electricity consumption by 35% while still maintaining the same level of cooling services currently produced. The study shows that the cooling savings potential is strongly influenced by level of household income, the level of building energy efficiency standards, cooling behavior characteristics and households' energy-saving consciousness. Policy implications are derived. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large population size and rapid economic growth have resulted in a huge amount of housing consumption in China. Therefore, it is critical to identify the determinants of housing carbon footprint (CF) and prepare appropriate carbon mitigation measures. By employing the IPCC accounting method, input-output analysis and the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model, this study aims to study the spatio-temporal patterns and identify the driving factors of housing CF. The results show that regional disparities and urban-rural differences existed during the period 2012-2017. The results of the extended STIRPAT model show that population scale and energy consumption per unit building area are the two dominant contributors to the housing CF increments in all areas. While, family size only shows significant negative impact in eastern and western regions, the per capita disposable income only induces higher housing CF in rural areas, and energy structure had a remarkable positive impact in urban area of western region and all rural areas. Policy recommendations are proposed to mitigate the overall housing CF, including; controlling population growth and promoting urbanization benefits; encouraging green consumption; optimizing household energy consumption structure, and; enhancing residential building energy management.

AB In this paper we estimate the relationship between urban sprawl and a measure of air quality, namely the number of days in which the PM10 concentration exceeds safeguard limits in European Union cities. Building on a multidimensional representation of sprawl, the paper employs several indicators to account for built-up area development, population density, and residential discontinuity. The paper employs generalised additive models to disentangle the nonlinear effects in the variables and the interaction effects of the three sprawl dimensions. A significant and robust effect of urban morphology emerges after controlling for socio-economic, demographic, and climatic factors and the geographical location of the city. We find that urban sprawl impacts positively on pollutant concentration, but the effect is highly context-specific because of threshold effects and interactions.

AB One of the major anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases is the operation of building stock. Improving its energy efficiency has the potential to significantly contribute to achieving climate change mitigation targets. The purpose of this study was to roughly estimate such potential for the operation of the national building stock of Czechia to steer the national debate on the development of related national plans. The estimation is based on a simplified energy model of the Czech building stock that consists of sub-models of residential and nonresidential building stocks, for which their future energy consumptions, shares of energy carriers and sources, and emission factors were modeled in four scenarios. Uncertainties from the approximation of the emission factors were investigated in a sensitivity analysis. The results showed that the operation of the Czech building stock in 2016 totaled 36.9 Mt CO2, which represented 34.6% of the total national carbon dioxide emissions. The four building stock scenarios could produce reductions in the carbon dioxide emissions of between 28% and 93% by 2050, when also considering on-side production from photovoltaics. The implementation of the most ambitious scenario would represent a drop in national CO2 yearly emissions by 43.2% by 2050 (compared to 2016).

AB Access to energy is a precondition for a decent standard of living. Some household decisions on energy consumption are however motivated to maintain or improve status, resulting in social zero-sum games, with environmentally harmful outcomes. Here, we review evidence relating status to energy consumption, elucidating consequential opportunities for climate change mitigation. To achieve this, we comprehensively collate and analyse existing published work that links status to household consumption decisions and behaviour across all end-use sectors, screening 2662 papers found with systematic search queries, identifying and fully reviewing 53 papers that comply with our criteria. We develop a systematic map of the literature and review quantitative and qualitative analysis relating energy end-use to status consumption. We identify 23 distinct (albeit some of them closely related) theories, with the literature most frequently referring to Veblen's theory of conspicuous consumption. We also detail estimations of status-related energy consumption and identify ten studies that quantitatively relate status to energy saving behaviour or decisions, and four studies that relate status to increased emissions. Status can explain up to 20% change in consumption levels or the willingness-to-pay for carbon reducing consumption. Surprisingly, we find that major status-related consumption decisions, such as for housing and big cars, are hardly captured by the literature that relates status consumption to energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. This is a considerable gap in the literature, omitting major sources of status related decisions with high carbon footprint. We conclude that framing energy saving behaviour as high status is a promising strategy for emission reduction. Progressive taxation of status items, such as floor space and vehicle size, can effectively internalize the positional externalities and signal social undesirability, but also reduce emissions.

AB Space heating accounts for the most significant share of final energy demand in buildings in colder climatic regions contributing to greenhouse gas emission. In addition, there is a lack of data available to assess spatially, the potential of space heating demand reduction in different buildings when considering typical building refurbishment measures. Hence, in this paper, a robust information socket for urban building stock is developed to assess the impact of energy efficiency measures on space heating demand savings and CO2 emission reduction potential in the existing buildings based on a Geographical Information System tool. The model considers the topology and thermal performance of different building categories; houses with and without thermal insulation, apartments, commercial, public, office, and industrial buildings. Three scenarios, a reference and two additional scenarios using Prishtina city as a case study, have been created for standard (scenario 1), and advanced energy efficiency (scenario 2) measures based on the government's proposed policies. The findings show that space heat demand saving potential for scenario 1 and 2 in comparison to the reference scenario was 50% and 68.5% respectively. Moreover, the CO2 emissions are reduced significantly from 502.3 mil kgCO(2)/year in reference scenario to 249.8 mil kgCO(2)/year for scenario 1 and 158.7 mil kgCO(2)/year in scenario 2 respectively.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze energy performance along with the effect on the improvement in the indoor environment and air quality through the empirical case of the Full Energy Efficiency Retrofit (EER) in Korea. To increase the improvement effect objectivity, changes before/after the Full EER were measured and compared through various special equipment. The Full EER implementation through energy diagnosis, indoor environment, and air quality measurement led to the derivation of seven areas of improvement. Considering the efficiency of energy cost, the optimal full EER model of alternatives based on the area was selected, and passive design techniques were applied to enhance improvement effect during design and construction.
   After building the Full EER, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV)/Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) satisfied the criteria (before the Full EER: unsatisfied) regarding the indoor environment. Concerning indoor air quality, more than 30% improvement was observed in all the items except CO2, and criteria were met. Considering changing heat source equipment, improvement in energy performance was compared by converting the usage of energy into carbon emission; it was reduced by 5.9% and 2.7% on a cooling/heating basis, respectively, and by approximately 12% ($14,000) regarding annual energy consumption cost.
   This result is expected to facilitate future Full EER activation by mitigating uncertainty regarding energy consumption cost for the Full EER improvement effect and demonstrating additional improvements related to the indoor environment and air quality.

AB The extent to which climate change and other factors will influence building energy use and population exposures to indoor pollutants is not well understood. Here, we develop and apply nationally representative residential energy and indoor pollutant model sets to estimate energy use, indoor pollutant concentrations, and associated chronic health outcomes across the U.S. residential building stock in the mid-21st century. The models incorporate expected changes in meteorological and ambient air quality conditions associated with IPCC RCP 8.5 and assumptions for changes in housing characteristics and population movements while keeping other less predictable factors constant. Site and source energy consumption for residential space-conditioning are predicted to decrease by similar to 37-43 and similar to 20-31%, respectively, in the 2050s compared to those in a 2010s reference scenario. Population-average indoor concentrations of pollutants of ambient origin are expected to decrease, except for O-3. Holding indoor emission factors constant, indoor concentrations of pollutants with intermittent indoor sources are expected to decrease by <5% (PM2.5) to >30% (NO2); indoor concentrations of pollutants with persistent indoor sources (e.g., volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) are predicted to increase by similar to 15-45%. We estimate negligible changes in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost associated with residential indoor pollutant exposures, well within uncertainty, although the attribution among pollutants is predicted to vary.

AB The damage to the environment caused by fossil-derived fuels is very high. Each year air pollution causes the death of close to 3 million people. This value is equivalent to 5% of the global annual death rate. In the literature, greenhouse gas emission calculations are made with data officially recorded from annual fuel and electricity consumption in housing on a provincial basis. These calculations do not differentiate energy consumed for heating, hot water or domestic appliances (fridge, air conditioning, washing machines, dishwashers, iron, oven, etc.). This study calculated energy requirements for heating and per person emissions with a new method taking account of different wall types, fuel and insulation material for Izmir province. The carbon dioxide amount released per unit area in the heating period (CDUAHP) and sulfur dioxide released per unit area in the heating period (SDUAHP) were compared according to wall, fuel and insulation material types and without insulation. The effect of optimum insulation thickness (OIT) on the environment and energy was calculated for Izmir. It was determined that with different fuel, isolation material and wall types, energy demand and CDUAHP reductions could reach 76% levels. Two new approaches of carbon dioxide amount per person in the heating period (CDPPHP) and sulfur dioxide amount per person in the heating period (SDPPHP) were developed. For 1TEIW with XPS according to OIT and coal as fuel, the CDPPHP was 836 kg/person year, while the SDPPHP for an uninsulated apartment was 7196 kg/person heating period, with 1727 kg person/heating period calculated according to OIT.

AB The growing urban population globally leads to higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and stress on the electricity networks for meeting the increasing demand. In the early urban design stages, the optimization of the urban morphology and building physics characteristics can reduce energy demand. Local generation using renewable energy resources is also a viable option to reduce emissions and improve grid reliability. Notwithstanding, energy simulation and environmental impact assessment of urban building design strategies are usually not done until the execution planning stage. To address this research gap, a novel framework for designing energy systems for zero-carbon districts is developed. An urban building energy model is integrated with an urban energy system model in this framework. Dynamic prediction of heating and cooling demand and automatic sizing of different energy system configurations based on the calculated demands are the framework's primary capabilities. The workability of the framework has been tested on a case study for an urban area in Montreal to design and compare two different renewable energy systems comprising photovoltaic panels (PV), air-source, and ground source heat pumps. The case study results show that the urban building energymodel could successfully predict the heating and cooling demands in multiple spatiotemporal resolutions, while the urban energy system model provides system solutions for achieving a zero-carbon or positive energy district.

AB The building and public works sector is, in France as in Europe, a major consumer of raw materials for both the manufacture of products and the construction of buildings and structures. This sector has a direct impact on the natural and built environment. This effect is even more pronounced in the case of isolated territories, such as islands. The latter have their own constraints (geographical location, production of the local grid mix) and particularities: very small territory, massive importation of goods in all fields, such as food, automobile, building, and others). In this study, we focus on the building branch of the construction industry, which covers housing (single-family houses and apartment blocks). The study is based on the analysis of about twenty single-family houses built in metropolitan France and Reunion Island. The construction standards for these two regions comply with European standards (CE) and French regulations. However, in the case of Reunion Island, a tropical island, it applies in particular to the Thermal, Acoustic, and Ventilation Regulations for New Buildings in Overseas Departments and Regions (RTAA DROM). The approach that is used for the environmental assessment of single-family homes is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), from cradle to grave. The results initially showed that there is an additional environmental cost in the construction sector between France and Reunion Island. This is initially due to the choice of origin of materials and products, which can greatly contribute to the impacts of construction. Secondly, to the use of the countries' electricity mix, which also contributes, in part, to the impact of the construction of these single-family homes during the assembly and transformation of the products. Finally, this additional cost also differs according to the transport used (sea, air, rail, road). For the Global Warming Potential (GWP) indicator, in our study we note that the additional environmental cost is 37% higher in Reunion Island. This figure explains the additional impact of the 218 kg-CO2eq/m(2) of built-up area built for Reunion Island. This study is one of the first analyses demonstrating the additional environmental cost that exists between mainland France and overseas France. Thus, the results demonstrate the importance of creating a specialized and regionalized database for the case of remote islands. Thus, this database would allow for professionals to have a precise environmental assessment, not on a national but on a regional scale. This document also provides a framework and guideline for policy decision-making in the overseas islands.

AB In the pursuit of mitigating the effects of climate change the European Union and the government of Finland have set targets for emission reductions for the near future. This study examined the carbon emission reduction potential in the Finnish energy system with power-to-heat (P2H) coupling of the electricity and heat sectors with different housing renovation levels. The measures conducted in the energy system were conducted as follows. Wind power generation was increased in the Finnish power system with 10 increments. For each of these, the operation of hydropower was optimized to maximize the utilization of new wind generation. The excess wind generation was used to replace electricity and heat from combined heat and power production for district heating. The P2H conversion was performed by either 2000 m deep borehole heat exchangers coupled to heat pumps, with possible priming of heat, or with electrode boilers. The housing stock renovated to different levels affected both the electricity and district heating demands. The carbon emission reduction potential of the building renovation measures, and the energy system measures were determined over 25 years. Together with the required investment costs for the different measures, unit costs of emission reductions, euro/t-CO2, were determined. The lowest unit cost solution of different measures was established, for which the unit cost of emission reductions was 241 euro/t-CO2 and the reduced carbon emissions 11.3 Mt-CO2 annually. Moreover, the energy system measures were found to be less expensive compared to the building renovation measures, in terms of unit costs, and the P2H coupling a cost-efficient manner to increase the emission reductions.

AB This research analyses the relation between building and housing attributes and energy consumption and CO2 emissions, considering the spatial dependence present on the Spanish residential market and the different climatic areas. The paper uses a hedonic model with spatial correlation. To measure the spatial dependence, we have combined the Lag Model and the Error Model. The data has been obtained from three different sources and merged in a complex geolocated database, for the provinces of Castellon and Valencia. The results of both regressions indicate that there is a spatial dependence in the sample and a relation between some building attributes and energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The regressions show the existence of low consumption and low emission clusters in the metropolitan area of Valencia and Castellon. Moreover, the endogenous variables indicate that characteristics such as the age, the size, the typology of the house building or dwelling, the use of the surface, or the climatic area have an effect in the energy consumption and the CO2 emissions of the houses in Castellon and Valencia.

AB As national efforts to reduce CO2 emissions towards achieving Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), policymakers require regional information for specific sectors to reduce uncertainties within national mitigation target. To understand the implementation barriers of the residential building sector towards achieving INDC, this study proposes an analytical framework for supporting robust decision making at the subnational level, in which a multi-objective optimisation model under uncertainty (MOOU) is developed for establishing decarbonisation pathways of the residential building sector. The proposed model has three key features: (1) systematic and robust decision-making with multi-objective optimisation of economic goals in the presence of uncertainties; (2) synergistic mitigation policies with gradual ramping-up adoption; and (3) quantitative evaluation of the finance provision and implementation rates of mitigation policies. The proposed model is then applied to provide in-depth insights into implementation barriers of 13 types of mitigation policies towards achieving INDCs targets in nine provinces in China, with parallel urban and rural analyses. Results show that the CO2 emissions of residential buildings in Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Beijing will have peaked by 2030. In particular, the CO2 emissions from cooling energy consumption of total building stocks will continually increase. Further-more, improvements of building thermal efficiency and energy mix dominate the mitigation potential in northern China, while the southern China largely depends on the improvement of the efficiency of home appliances. The differences in measures' mitigation effectiveness cause that southern China provinces have higher risks for achieving the subnational INDCs targets compared to northern China.

ID DECLINE
AB Carbon emissions, being hazardous, are triggering social concerns which have led to the creation of international treaties to address climate change. Similarly, the United Kingdom under the Climate Change Act (2008) has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emission by at least 80% over 1990 levels by 2050. However, being the oldest member of the EU states (before Brexit), the UK has the oldest housing stock, which contributes to 45% of its carbon emissions due to the older dwellings. To address this issue low carbon retrofitting is needed. Therefore, this paper seeks to investigate the barriers and enablers to energy efficiency retrofitting in social housing in London, UK based on the perception of experts employed in National and construction companies with an experience that ranges between 6 to 16 years. Initial literature suggested that the problem of energy efficiency retrofitting in the general building stock has been addressed, however little has been reported on its application to social housing. This paper, therefore, groups the barriers and enablers into seven categories that include: financial matters, Technical, IT, Government policy and regulation, social factors (including awareness of the energy efficiency agenda), quality of workmanship and disruption to residents, using literature review, interviews and surveys with key stakeholders within the housing sector, and draws recommendations to enable effective and efficient retrofitting for social housing projects.

AB The building sector contributes significantly to global energy consumption and CO2 emissions. It is urgent to reduce them through the retrofit of the current building stock and improvements in new building designs. The energy performance contracts that can deliver energy consumption savings must have an attractive rate of return to make financial sense for public and private sector buildings. These contracts must also have a wide uptake in the market to improve significantly the energy performance of the building stock. This paper develops a hybrid bottom up and system dynamics modelling framework to: (1) explore the diffusion of energy performance contracts and its effect on operational building energy consumption and (2) facilitate integration into policy making. The bottom up modelling component is used to provide estimates of potential operational building energy use savings. The estimates are the input to the system dynamics diffusion model which is used to explore diffusion pathways of energy performance contracts. The framework will facilitate scenario and policy analysis for the diffusion of the contracts on the building stock and their potential impact on energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions.

AB Retail stores are amongst the building typologies with the highest carbon (CI) and energy intensities (EI). However, previous studies have only explored best practice EI of food and non-food retailers, without identifying best practice CI threshold values. This paper presents a five-step analysis of CI and EI amongst the highest revenue retailers, benchmarking best and worst performing CI and EI retailers, analysing their nationality, performing a content analysis on their CSR reports and comparing results in terms of differentiation policies, strategies and building practices that can lead to increased environmental performance. Combined CI and EI best practice threshold values were found simultaneously under 346 kWh/m(2)/y and 115 kg CO(2)eq/m(2)/y for food retailers and under 146 kWh/m(2)/y and 70 kg CO(2)eq/m(2)/y for non-food retailers. In terms of policy, best-performing retailers shared a strong top-down management commitment towards sustainability across all business areas (p = 0.04) and an increased use of referential reporting standards, particularly of GRI standards (p = 0.05) and of the GHG protocol (p = 0.01). In terms of strategy, they established ambitious energy goals, such becoming 100% supplied by renewable energy (p = 0.05) or carbon neutral by 2020. As for building practice, LED and photovoltaic technology were the most popular high-performance solutions, but only the use of natural refrigerants (p = 0.001) and gas transfer to CO2 (p = 0.0007) were related to best-performing practice. The variability of CI and EI found in this study shows that it is already possible to reduce the retail sector's contribution to global GHG emissions considerably. The proposed best practice CI and EI reference levels, linked to corporate policy, strategy and building practice, are useful new tools for retail energy-management, which can further promote sustainability in retail buildings, thus allowing a deeper understanding of how to decarbonize the retail building sector.

AB Radiant floor systems have the potential to reduce energy consumption and the carbon footprint of buildings. This study analyzed a novel radiant panel configuration comprising a metal plate with small spikes that can be pressed into cement board or wood. The behavior of this configuration was simulated for different materials for the metal plate, spike dimensions, and varying spacing between spikes. An annual energy simulation model compared the radiant panel configuration with the traditional concrete-based system. Simulations were run under heating dominant, cooling dominant, and neutral conditions; significant cost savings and greenhouse gas emission reduction were seen across all scenarios.

AB Solar photovoltaic (PV) is an important strategy to de-carbonize the energy sector in the United States and to reduce the health, environmental, and climate change damages associated with the production of electricity from fossil fuel sources. While the potential for solar PV in the residential and commercial sectors has been widely studied, the potential in educational buildings is largely unknown. Educational institutions account for 11% of total US building electricity consumption and 14% of building floorspace. These buildings also contribute to approximately 4% of total USCO2 emissions, thus playing a potentially important role in climate mitigation strategies. We estimate the electricity use for 132k educational institutions across the US and estimate electricity generation, greenhouse gas and health damaging air emissions reductions, and private and social costs and benefits that would result from adopting rooftop solar PV. We find that solar PV in US educational institutions could provide 100 TWh of electricity services annually, meeting 75% of these buildings' current electricity consumption. We estimate the highest generation potential in Texas, California, and Florida with K-12 public educational institutions comprising the bulk of that generation. The provision of electricity services from rooftop solar PV on educational institutions could reduce health, environmental, and climate change damages by roughly $4 billion per year (assuming a social cost of carbon of $40/ton and value of statistical life of $10M in 2018 USD). Two key findings from this study are that: (i) the private costs of solar for educational institutions still exceed the private benefits from reduced electricity consumption across the entire country (unless a third party operation model is used, in which case some locations can have net-benefits), and (ii) with the exceptions of California and New York, the social health, environmental and climate change benefits exceed the levels of current incentives provided by the state and retail subsidies.

AB Urban areas contribute significant carbon emissions. Evaluating and analysing the spatial distribution of carbon emissions are the foundations of low-carbon city development and carbon emissions reduction. In this study, carbon emission inventory was first constructed and carbon emissions in Wuhan were estimated on the basis of energy consumption. Second, the spatial distribution models of carbon emissions in different sectors were developed on the basis of the census of the Wuhan geographical conditions data and other thematic data. Third, the carbon emission distribution in Wuhan was analyzed at the central urban, functional, new urban, built-up, and metropolitan development area scale. Results show that the industry sector emits most of the carbon emissions in Wuhan, followed by the residential population. Carbon emissions in the metropolitan development area can stand for the true carbon emissions in Wuhan. Thus, a geographically weighted (GW) model was adopted to analyze the correlation coefficients between economical-social factors (gross domestic product, population density, road density, industrial land and residential land) and carbon emissions in the metropolitan development area. Comparisons with other studies show that the disaggregation method we proposed in this work, especially the adoption of geographical condition census data, can reflect the spatial distribution of carbon emissions of different sectors at the city scale.

DE Electricity consumption; EUI; buildings; Pakistan
ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; APPLIANCES
AB Buildings consume one-third of final energy consumption in the world and are graded as the largest sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Buildings energy consumption is driven by numerous factors that have direct or indirect effects on it. Identification of such factors could help building designers and architectures in introducing energy efficient designs of various types of buildings. Such studies are indispensable for countries such as Pakistan where a very limited research has been published in this area. This study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the effect of numerous factors on the residential electricity consumption and further, aims to establish an electricity usage intensity (EUI) value for the residential sector of Pakistan. Data were collected from 523 dwellings through site surveys and interviews with residents. Effect of 48 different variables, (five socioeconomic variables, 14 dwelling variables, 22 variables from electric appliances details, five demographic variables and two variables from renewable energy sources) was investigated on the residential buildings annual electricity consumption using SPSS software. It was found that 17 out of 48 variables have significant linear relationship with annual electricity consumption. Further, through a multivariate analysis, it was found that annual electricity usage intensity (EUI) for Pakistan's residential buildings is 24kWh/m(2). Finally, this EUI value is compared with the same of two major South Asian countries. It is observed that mean EUI of Pakistan is almost similar to that of India, i.e. 24kWh/m 2 whereas Bangladesh has a higher value of mean EUI, i.e. 32kWh/m(2).

AB A great deal of attention is paid to secondary refrigeration as a means of reducing excessively high emissions of refrigerants (most of which have a potent greenhouse effect) due to leaks in large cooling units. Among the environmentally friendly fluids that can be used in secondary circuits for transporting and storing cold, hydrate slurries offer the advantage of significant latent heats of fusion associated with good fluidity. Research programs have focused attention on hydrate systems, including CO2, TBPB (tetra-n-butyl-phosphonium-bromide), and mixed CO2-TBPB hydrates. In addition to feasibility concerns, energy efficiency is also a crucial concern requiring an objective analysis of the improvements likely to result from these new materials. A numerical model of secondary refrigeration system was built for slurries ranging from ice-slurry to TBPB-CO2 mixed hydrate slurries. The circuit was designed for maximizing performance under various constraints relating to power rate, heat transfer areas, and flow ability. The effects of phase change kinetics on thermal exchanges were introduced in the model and in the exergy balance. The results, analyzed in terms of exergy losses, demonstrate the couplings through which kinetics influences global performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most climate change mitigation schemes in urban planning concentrate on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the distant future by altering the urban form and encouraging more sustainable behaviour. However, to reach climate change mitigation targets, a more immediate reduction in GHG emissions is also needed as well as a reduction in GHG emissions in other fields. This article evaluates the important role of earthworks in the prompt and substantial reduction required for GHG emissions. The research includes a single case study and three focus group interviews. The results of the case study reveal the magnitude of possible emission reductions through urban planners' control over earthworks, whereas the findings of the focus groups shed light on the relevance of the findings beyond the single case. Three urban planning solutions were implemented in the case area to reduce GHG emissions from earth construction, resulting in the saving of 2360 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Notable savings were also achieved in other emission categories. Such a successful management of rock and soil material flows requires a strong vision from the urban planner, cooperation among many different actors, and smart decisions in multiple planning phases. Furthermore, numerical data is needed to confirm the environmental benefits if the coordination of earthworks is to be widely included in regional climate change mitigation strategies.

AB Domestic energy use accounts for more than a quarter of total energy use in the United Kingdom (UK), with space and water heating accounting for almost 80% of this consumption. Energy efficiency is often the simplest and most cost-effective way of reducing energy use, and improving domestic energy efficiency can contribute significantly to reducing the UK's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A significant proportion of the UK's energy stock remains inefficient, and over 80% of current housing stock will still be standing in 2050. Therefore, retrofitting existing buildings is fundamental to achieving energy efficiency improvements in the domestic sector. In order to reduce carbon emissions and improve domestic energy efficiency, the UK government launched the Green Deal in 2013 to improve the energy efficiency in buildings in the UK, reduce emissions from homes by 29%, and help meet carbon reduction targets. It aimed to overcome existing perceived barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency measures in the home and enable households and businesses to make energy-saving improvements to their properties, delivering a range of important benefits to the owner/occupier as a result. This paper critically assesses the impact of the Green Deal in shaping pro-environmental behaviours by drawing on two case studies. Lessons learnt from the UK's Green Deal energy policy are presented, and implications for the UK government's role in shaping energy policy and pro-environmental behaviours are considered.

AB Improving the energy efficiency of the UK housing stock is important both to meet carbon emission reduction targets and to reduce fuel poverty. For this reason, domestic properties are frequently retrofitted with energy saving measures. This study looks at how the energy consumption, thermal properties and internal temperature of 14 dwellings change as a result of a solid wall insulation (SWI) retrofit. A decrease in heat transfer coefficient of 111(-7)(+6)% was calculated for 2 dwellings, which is slightly lower than the previously modelled value of 18%. However, many houses displayed evidence that the full benefit of SWI was not being realised as, for example, energy savings were offset with increases in internal temperature. Future retrofit schemes should therefore consider supplementing the changes in fabric with increased guidance for the occupant. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB With the recent development of sustainable design trend, the major areas to consider are energy resources, construction techniques and materials, water usage and waste in architectural designs. There is no that doubts that controlling these elements through creative designs, innovation, specification, and every element have impact on the atmosphere. Materials have a tremendous effect on environmental issues, from climate alteration to alternative resources, biodiversity trouncing, waste amounts and types, and health issues. The embodied product's life cycle consume energy appends to climate change and carbon emissions, whilst the effect differentiates between types of materials. Therefore, optimizing passive solar design terminology is the simplest and most efficient approach to reduce energy required by construction. Passive design relies on active technologies and renewable energy sources. The simplicity of passive design principles allows designers to effortlessly integrate it in their projects. In this research, the study is oriented to examine the appliance of passive measures in residential buildings in Famagusta besides tasting the contortions of interior surfaces on the buildings' thermal behavior. Structured criteria used to select case studies to analyses day lighting, solar gain, energy consumption and prospective insolation energy. Both qualitative and quantitative methodologies adapted into comparison and problem solving methodology to achieve opportune results. Lack of considering passive parameters and material selection specifications affects directly the energy efficiency of the building, thus curtain strategies are recommended for effective energy management, constructing techniques and passive optimization concepts.

AB The scientific finding that humanity is overburdening nature and thus risks further ecological crises is almost uncontroversial. Main reason for the crises is the drastic increase in the societal metabolism, which is accomplished through labour. In this article, we examine the societal metabolism-labour nexus in two energy regimes: a valley in the Ethiopian highlands, typical of an agrarian society, and a village in Austria, typical of an industrial society. In the Ethiopian village, the supply of food demands almost the entire labour force, thus limiting the capacity to facilitate material flows beyond food provision. In the Austrian village, fewer working hours, lower workloads but 50 times higher useful energy allow to accumulate stocks like buildings 70 times higher than the Ethiopian case. With fossil energy, industrial societies decisively expand their energy supply and reduce labour hours at the cost of high carbon emissions, which are almost non-existent in the Ethiopian case. To overcome the resulting ecological crises, there is a call to drastically reduce fossil fuel consumption. Such an abandonment of fossil fuels might have as far reaching consequences for the societal metabolism-labour nexus and consequently human labour as the introduction of fossil fuels has had.

AB The first-ever legally binding global climate deal that will be adopted by 195 countries was introduced in Paris in 2015, highlighting that climate change is being recognised as a real and urgent global problem. Legislative interventions need to be accompanied by significant action across all sectors of the built environment through reducing energy demand, providing energy supply from low carbon sources and combining with this with energy storage to enable necessary targets to be met. Retrofitting existing buildings is critical to making these cuts as 80% of buildings currently in existence will still be present in 2050. These retrofits need to be undertaken rapidly using replicable and affordable solutions that benefit both the householder whilst significantly reducing emissions. This paper will present an evaluation of a 9.6 pound million regional scale retrofit programme funded under the Welsh Governments Arbed 1 Programme which aimed to reduce fuel poverty, reduce carbon emissions and support the energy efficiency and renewable supply chain and encourage recruitment and training in the sector. Results have been obtained from desk top data collection and energy modelling calculations. The evaluation work presents the technical, environmental and economic impacts of the programme and demonstrates lessons learnt to help improve the implementation of the other regional retrofit projects providing evidence of the impacts of a large scale retrofit programme that are necessary for the deep carbon reductions required in the near future.

TI Life cycle production and costs of a residential solar hot water and

SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

ID PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY
AB Hot and humid climates with high solar radiation have the potential to offset residential building energy consumption with the application of solar hot water and photovoltaic electricity generation. However, costs, lack of incentives for the systems, and the need for proof-of-concepts continue to limit market penetration. The surplus of natural gas in certain areas of the United States, particularly Texas, continues to keep gas and electricity production economical compared to solar alternatives. However, trends that demand lower energy homes, a desire for local energy independence, and the lowering of carbon dioxide emissions continue to fuel solar energy systems penetration. To support solar use, this research was performed to evaluate and analyze the real-world life cycle energy and costs of a solar photovoltaic and solar hot water system (SHWS) installed on a high-end residential home in Houston, TX (IECC Zone 2). The house was a well-insulated, large urban home with two renewable energy systems installed: a 3.5kW solar photovoltaic system (SPVS) and a 1.71kW solar hot water system. Analyses were part of a larger study performed to investigate the contributions of the solar energy off-sets on the operational energy of the building over a life cycle period of 30-years. Field measurements of energy production were compared to solar energy simulations based on the typical meteorological year and the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) data. NSRDB provided the basis for a probabilistic interpretation of annual energy production in terms of probability measures, P50/P90. It was found that field estimates were within simulation uncertainties and P90 predictions were within 2.5% of TMY3 (typical meteorological year data 3) results for both the solar photovoltaic system (SPVS) and solar hot water system (SHWS). Additionally, optimizations in the system design and life cycle costs were investigated to determine the annual optimal performance for the solar energy systems. The SHWS was installed at a less than optimum azimuth of 270 degrees instead of 180 degrees (corresponding to a 16% reduction in annual output). The SPVS was installed at optimal design conditions of 180 degrees azimuth and 42 degrees tilt. Payback and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) could have been minimized with the addition of another solar hot water collector with a minimal impact to overall cost. Cost sensitivity analysis on the LCOE and net-present value (NPV) were also performed and over a 30-year life cycle period, TMY3 based simulations predicted a NPV of $ 796 (21.8-year non-discounted payback) and -$ 1246 (29.2-year non-discounted payback) for the SHWS and SPVS, respectively. The SHWS achieved a LCOE of 8.1 (sic)/kWh, while the value for the SPVS was 12.29 (sic)/kWh. For the SPVS, the photovoltaic module and collector costs were the largest life cycle costs, and of special note, a reduction in the module cost by 67% reduces the LCOE to the market average-high electricity price of 10 (sic)/kWh. Finally, the combined renewable energy systems generated an estimated 30-year life-cycle energy production of 184 814 kWh, with auxiliary gas provided for supplemental hot-water heating. On average, a Texas residential home utilizes 420 000 kWh of electrical energy, 19% of which is domestic hot water demand. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Background: Reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions in order to address climate change requires behavioral changes by the citizens, who will have to adopt more environmentally friendly and energy-saving practices.
   Methods: We present a system and corresponding practices for gathering energy consumption data from public school buildings over the Internet, processing them to identify hidden correlations and produce actionable advice and presenting the results in real-time to its occupants over the Web. We describe the metering infrastructure installed at schools for energy consumption monitoring and the related actions carried out in order to motivate local school communities towards an environmentally friendly behavior. The introduction of IPv6 was found to be a key enabling technology for setting up such a system in a simple, secure, and efficient way.
   Results: The proposed system and processes are put under test in a pilot installation composed of about 50 IPv6-enabled schools of the Greek School Network (GSN). These are also combined with appropriate educational and social engagement tools. In this way, energy consumption, operating costs, and greenhouse effects can be reduced in the area of educational and public administration buildings in general. Thus, people become almost instantly aware of the energy and environmental implications of their actions, which motivates them towards behavioral changes and the adoption of environmentally friendly practices.
   Conclusions: The pilot provides a good example of collaboration between the ICT sector, the smart building and automation vendors, and the public authorities.

AB Different policies of the UK government have been initiated to reduce energy consumption in the housing sector. Various models have been developed to analyse the impact of these policies, which are classified as disciplinary or multidisciplinary models comprising variables related to technology, economic, sociology, occupants behaviour and climate. While being multidisciplinary, these models have limitations in simulating the complexity of household energy consumption. As a sociotechnical problem, this research aims to develop a system dynamics model to analyse profiles of household energy consumption considering the interrelationships among these influential variables. The model can assess the effect of different energy initiatives before/during their implementation. The proposed model has been used to test the effectiveness of the UK initiative Green Deal (GD) based on the most recent statistics released by the government. The model results indicate that carbon dioxide emissions savings of about 40% and 60% below the base year of 1990 are possible by 2020 and 2050, respectively. As a policy advice tool, this means that it is unlikely for this initiative by its own to meet the required legally binding reductions of 80% cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 unless the GD initiative is vigorously pursued with other energy initiatives.

AB Understanding activities within premises can contribute to a fuller understanding of energy use within buildings and the building stock. Analysis of detailed surveys of over 300 non-domestic premises has produced empirical room-scale space-use profiles for 16 premises types. Electricity consumption and internal gains resulting from the operation of electrical appliances have been characterized for 295 combinations of internal space use and premises activity type. For each combination, the outputs include the energy-use intensity (kWh/m(2)/year) profiles for: overall appliance consumption; 14 end uses of appliances (e.g. lighting, catering, computing); and 18 groups of appliance activity descriptions (e.g. sales, office work, process). These profiles of characteristics were created for application in an urban-scale energy-use model, based upon premises floor space recorded in property taxation data, without the need for detailed energy surveys of premises. Appliance electricity consumption and internal gains are revealed at a finer spatial resolution than previous methods, indicating the diversity of energy-use characteristics in greater detail than for entire homogenized premises or premises types. This method may be used for evaluating the current electricity consumption and consequent carbon emissions from the non-domestic building stock (or parts thereof) and for estimating the effects of potential interventions.

AB Policy for reducing carbon emissions from non-domestic buildings in the UK relies at present on survey and modelling work carried out in the 1990s. The UK government's Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is engaged in a programme of new research to update this evidence base. The work has two main components. The first is a database - the National Energy Efficiency Data framework (NEED) - in which floor area and activity data for non-domestic premises are being linked to electricity and gas consumption at the individual property level. The second is a research project of sample surveys designed to elicit information about buildings and energy use, but also opportunities for abatement and the behavioural and organizational factors affecting efficiency improvements. A pilot survey of the food and mixed retail sector has been carried out in advance of further surveys of the entire range of building types. The research programme is described along with some of the methodological problems it raises.

AB Emission reduction activities in the European Union (EU) in- and outside the European Trading System (ETS) thus far have largely taken place separately. One possibility to combine the two is through linking Non-ETS offset project-based crediting schemes in the form of Joint Implementation or domestic offset (DO) projects with the EU ETS. Linking would allow non-ETS offset project-based CO2 credits to be traded within the ETS market. This paper discusses the merits and drawbacks of the implementation of a DO scheme in the built environment in the Netherlands. The built environment can be characterised as a sector with a great diversity and significant energy savings potential. Emphasis is paid on the modalities for estimating energy savings under DO projects. The authors discuss if next to existing EU, national or regional policies in the Netherlands, DO could spur initiatives in sub-sectors or market areas that are difficult to reach with conventional policy instruments. Thus, despite the existing policy framework in this sector, there could be still space for DO to reach the untapped energy savings potential. DO can support activities and technologies that are not covered by other policy instruments, either because they are not part of the instruments focus or are above the minimum requirements of the incumbent policy targets. It is expected that some lessons from this study in the Netherlands can be taken into account also by other countries facing similar market circumstances, which have implemented several policy instruments and are considering DO schemes as an alternative for capturing part of the untapped energy saving potential in their end use sectors. Another possible advantage of DO is that is has the potential to reduce public spending on existing policy goals, when it is considered in conjunction with existing public financing instruments. In order to tap into this potential, there are a series of hurdles in place, like additionality and the current CO2 price levels, while transaction and administration costs must be kept low.

AB The UK government has ambitious goals to reduce national carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and has targeted the new and existing built stock with measures to improve building performance and provide more local and centralized renewable energy. New dwellings are proposed to be 'net-zero carbon' by 2016, which includes proposals to offset CO2 by integrating new and existing development. To what extent can new zero-carbon communities be more readily achieved through increasing the integration between new and existing domestic developments? A methodology is presented for determining the ratio of on-site renewable energy supply to energy demand for a series of densities using a simplified model. Options that increase the proportion of existing dwellings served by a new development to balance further energy demands are presented. The practical opportunities and constraints are considered for integrating new and existing domestic development to achieve net-zero carbon. Meeting net-zero on-site annual energy requirements through on-site energy resources is possible even at high urban densities, with annual average supply/demand ratios of approximately 2.3. Also, integrating existing dwellings may offer an opportunity to improve supply/demand ratios for further CO2 reductions; low densities are shown to have annual supply/demand ratios of approximately 9.5. Although a finer temporal scale illustrates the limitations of an annual average and the variable nature of on-site energy resources; this straightforward method can act as a catalyst in achieving net-zero-carbon communities. Le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni s'est fixe des objectifs ambitieux de reduction des emissions de dioxyde de carbone (CO2) au niveau national et a decide de viser le parc bati existant et les constructions neuves par des mesures destinees a ameliorer les performances des batiments et a fournir davantage d'energies renouvelables locales et centralisees. Il est propose que les nouveaux logements soient << zero carbone net >> d'ici a 2016, ceci incluant des propositions pour compenser le CO2 par l'integration des ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux. Dans quelle mesure peut-on parvenir plus facilement a de nouvelles communautes zero carbone en augmentant l'integration entre les ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux? Il est presente une methodologie permettant de determiner le rapport entre l'offre en energies renouvelables locales et la demande en energie pour une serie de densites d'habitation en utilisant un modele simplifie. Sont presentes des choix qui augmentent la part des logements existants desservis par un nouvel ensemble de logements afin d'equilibrer les demandes d'energie supplementaires. Les possibilites et les contraintes pratiques relatives a l'integration des ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux pour atteindre le << zero carbone net >> sont examinees. Il est possible de repondre a des besoins energetiques annuels locaux << zero carbone net >> par des ressources energetiques locales, meme avec des densites urbaines elevees, pour des rapports annuels moyens offre/demande d'environ 2.3. De plus, le fait d'integrer les logements existants peut donner la possibilite d'ameliorer les rapports offre/demande afin de reduire encore les emissions de CO2; il est montre que des densites d'habitation faibles presentent des rapports annuels offre/demande d'environ 9.5.
   Bien qu'une echelle de temps plus fine illustre les limites d'une moyenne annuelle et la nature variable des ressources energetiques ocales, cette methode simple peut faire office de catalyseur pour realiser des communautes << zero carbone net >>.

ID LIMIT-CYCLES
AB This paper considers an economy using a technology that adds to a stuck of pollution. Examples that come to mind are SO-emissions from burning coal accumulating in the soil and CO2-emissions from fossil-energy use which art: retained in the atmosphere. The stock of pollutants is subject to natural decay. albeit not necessarily of the simple often assumed linear type. In addition, a clean or so-called backstop technology is available that requires costly investments but is: characterized by low variable costs (e.g., solar energy or wind power). The costly investments imply a slow build-up of the capacity of the backstop, On the modelling side. this is an essential extension of most of the literature that considers the: unrealistic case where a backstop is instantaneously available. The second extension the present paper makes is to consider not only the planning problem but also the competitive outcomes. One of the interesting results is that stable limit cycles may characterize the socially optimal long-run outcome as well as the competitive equilibrium. Ln a competitive equilibrium pollution-control policy is not necessarily optimal in the sense of corresponding with the social optimum. Although cycling can occur in a competitive equilibrium just as: in the social optimum, relaxation of the control increases the set of parameter values for which complex and unstable behavior arises.

AB In recent years, researchers have expressed growing concern regarding the environmental impact of traditional binders such as lime and cement. This has led to an increased focus on finding alternative materials that not only meet the demands of modern construction but also align with international initiatives for eco-friendly building practices. In response to this need, alkali-activated materials have emerged as a promising substitute for conventional binders. However, the current production processes for alkali-activated materials involve substantial energy consumption and carbon emissions, presenting a global challenge in the quest for sustainable construction practices. This paper aims to present a novel proposition: utilizing construction and demolition waste as a potential precursor for manufacturing alkali-activated materials. Drawing upon a comprehensive survey and analysis of pertinent literature from diverse sources, this paper synthesizes a wealth of knowledge. The extensive review encompasses a thorough analysis of existing research findings, allowing for a nuanced exploration of the utilization of construction and demolition waste as a viable precursor in the manufacturing process of alkaliactivated materials. Construction and demolition waste typically contains significant amounts of silica and alumina, making it an attractive and sustainable alternative for alkali-activated materials production. Moreover, this approach offers the additional benefit of mitigating the environmental repercussions associated with waste disposal. By providing an extensive overview of existing literature on the use of construction and demolition waste as a precursor for alkali-activated materials production, this paper also identifies crucial areas that warrant further research in this field.

AB The speedy raise of residential buildings' carbon emissions is a hindrance to achieving China's 2030 carbon peak goal. This study constructs an assessment framework for comprehensive consideration of 30 Chinese provinces' socioeconomic circumstances, energy demand, and emissions reduction technology to meet the consistent coupling degree of equity and efficiency (CDEE). This study is the first to propose an allocation scheme for equilibrating provincial carbon increments for rural and urban residential buildings in 2030 under carbon peaking constraints. The relevant results are fourfold. (1) Residential building's floor area per capita and energy carbon emissions coefficients are the soliddest drivers to facilitate and inhibit the raise of carbon emissions during 2010-2020. (2) Through dynamic Monte Carlo simulation from 2021 to 2030, we demonstrate that provinces with the most gamey carbon emissions in urban and rural areas include Shandong, at 121.52 (+/- 5.50) Mt. and Hebei, at 61.34 (+/- 3.08) Mt. in 2030, respectively. (3) A CDEE of 52.3% (biased equity) in urban areas and 34.5% (biased efficiency) in rural areas indicates equilibrated allocation of provincial carbon increment. (4) In the final 2030 allocation scheme, the greatest carbon mitigation pressures are in Beijing (11.34 Mt) and Heilongjiang (3.23 Mt), and the provinces with the largest carbon increment in urban areas include Hebei, Henan, and Guangdong, while the largest carbon increments in rural areas are in Hebei, Henan, and Guangdong. Overall, this study furnishes a targeted and valuable decision making reference for the government to determine provincial carbon peak goals for Chinese residential buildings.

AB The residential sector is targeted for emission reduction in the climate action plans of many countries. These plans typically focus on reducing the operational energy of the residential sector only, with little focus on the embodied emissions of its construction. To fully decabonise the residential sector both operational and embodied carbon emissions would need to be eliminated.This paper presents whole life carbon quantification of the Irish residential sector, which aggregates the carbon emitted in operating the national housing stock, as well as the carbon emitted year on year in building and maintaining it. A detailed methodology is presented for both baselining, and forecasting, the emissions due to the residential sector. Operational emissions from space heating, hot water provision and electricity usage in the home are amalgamated. Embodied emissions, which are distributed across almost all categories of the national carbon inventory, are also estimated. The whole life carbon emissions of the residential sector account for approximately 25% of the total GHG emissions reported in the national carbon inventories. Modelled forecasts to 2030 are presented for national plans that aim to reduce emissions through retrofit and electricity decarbonisation, but will result in increased embodied emissions through planned housing development. The current Climate Action Plan for reduction of residential sector operational carbon fall short of achieving sectoral target reductions. Additional measures will be required if the sector is to meet its proportional share and sectoral emission ceiling. Even if these are achieved, gains that might accrue from home retrofit and electricity decarbonisation will be negated by the growth in embodied emissions deriving from housing development outlined in government plans, when the sector is considered from a whole life carbon perspective.Forecasts for operational emissions including business as usual and national sectoral targeted reduction scenarios of 40% are outlined. A range of scenarios are then presented to achieve emission reduction across the whole of the residential sector in line with the national 51% reduction targets. These will require; strategic targeting of the worst performing homes for retrofit first, complete decarbonisation of electricity, reduction in the size of future homes, as well as a major reduction in the embodied carbon of building materials used for residential construction. Activation, and renovation, of existing and vacant properties could accelerate the number of homes available while offsetting the need for extensive new construction.

AB The rural energy transition is critical in China's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality and improve air quality. However, the costs and health benefits associated with the transition to carbon neutrality remain unclear. Here we explore the cost-effective transition pathways and air quality-related health impacts using an integrated energy-air quality-health modeling framework. We find that decarbonizing rural cooking and heating would triple contemporary energy consumption from 2014 to 2060, considerably reducing energy poverty nationwide. By 2060, electric cooking ranges and air-to-air heat pumps should be widely integrated, costing an additional 13 billion USD nationally in transformation costs, with similar to 40% concentrated in Shandong, Heilongjiang, Shanxi and Hebei provinces. Rural residential decarbonization would remarkably improve air quality in northern China, yielding substantial health co-benefits. Notably, monetized health benefits in most provinces are projected to offset transformation costs, except for certain relatively lower-development southwestern provinces, implying more financial support for rural residents in these areas will be needed.

AB Land use change is one of the key reasons for the rise in global carbon emissions. Incorporating practical methods for carbon governance into the major strategic decisions of countries around the world is important for controlling carbon emissions. This study aims to carry out a regional land use carbon budget assessment and build a carbon balance zoning optimization framework. As a result, China will be better able to implement low-carbon strategies and reach carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Using the data of land use and energy consumption for Henan Province from 2000 to 2020, a carbon budget assessment system was constructed. According to the analysis of the geographical distribution of carbon budget, an evaluation system was developed and a carbon balance partition was established from the natural, economic, ecological and resource structure. A regionally differentiated development strategy was proposed. The findings revealed that: (1) Land use carbon emissions of Henan Province reflected a significant increasing trend, while the variation in carbon absorption of land use was stable. Carbon emissions increased by 87,120.25x104 t in 2020 compared to 2000, but the carbon absorption remained at approximately 1735x104 t over the years and there was an overall state of carbon deficit. (2) The geographical distribution of carbon emissions in Henan Province was characterized by higher in the central part and lower in the surroundings, and the distribution of carbon absorption was higher in the west and lower in the east. The distribution pattern was closely related to the level of land use and the structure of energy consumption. (3) From the carbon balance analysis, the 158 counties in Henan Province were divided into four carbon balance functional areas, namely the carbon sink functional area, low-carbon development area, carbon intensity control area, and high-carbon optimization area. Different optimized development strategies were proposed for each functional area.

AB The rising awareness of environmental issues and the increase of renewable energy sources (RESs) has led to a shift in energy production toward RES, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, and toward a distributed generation (DG) model of energy production that requires systems in which energy is generated, stored, and consumed locally. In this work, we present a methodology that integrates geographic information system (GIS)-based PV potential assessment procedures with models for the estimation of both energy generation and consumption profiles. In particular, we have created an innovative infrastructure that co-simulates PV integration on building rooftops together with an analysis of households' electricity demand. Our model relies on high spatiotemporal resolution and considers both shadowing effects and real-sky conditions for solar radiation estimation. It integrates methodologies to estimate energy demand with a high temporal resolution, accounting for realistic populations with realistic consumption profiles. Such a solution enables concrete recommendations to be drawn in order to promote an understanding of urban energy systems and the integration of RES in the context of future smart cities. The proposed methodology is tested and validated within the municipality of Turin, Italy. For the whole municipality, we estimate both the electricity absorbed from the residential sector (simulating a realistic population) and the electrical energy that could be produced by installing PV systems on buildings' rooftops (considering two different scenarios, with the former using only the rooftops of residential buildings and the latter using all available rooftops). The capabilities of the platform are explored through an in-depth analysis of the obtained results. Generated power and energy profiles are presented, emphasizing the flexibility of the resolution of the spatial and temporal results. Additional energy indicators are presented for the self-consumption of produced energy and the avoidance of CO2 emissions.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

AB Densely built areas are affected by higher air-pollutant concentrations, representing a significant risk to public health. At the same time, urban settlements have a remarkable environmental impact: cities are responsible for 70% of annual carbon emissions while buildings account for 37% of global energy and process emissions. Moreover, people living in urban areas are frequently exposed to extreme micro-climate conditions caused by the urban heat island effect, related to increased external air temperature and peculiarities of the built environment. Given this framework and considering the Sustainable Development Goals, it is necessary to point out some effective and strategical mitigation measures to ameliorate micro-climate conditions, reduce pollutants con-centration and enhance building performance. This paper investigates the potential advantages of green roofs as retrofitting solutions and tree planting on several micro-climate parameters and particulate matter concentra-tion, considering an industrial district located in Italy and using ENVI-met software. The influence of the extensive green roof on energy performance is further investigated at the building level recurring to Design Builder energy models. Results showed that an extensive green roof could reduce external air temperature by up to 1.5 degrees C, outer surface temperature by up to 15 degrees C and wind speed by 50% at roof level compared to current state conditions. The application of the green roof let also to achieve energy savings of 15% for both the summer and winter seasons. Focusing on the effect on particulate matter, intensive green roof solutions proved to be more efficient in capturing air pollutants.

AB Urban areas represent key opportunities for mitigation efforts through supporting renewable energy systems, improving urban planning, and increasing resource efficiency. This research work develops two types of urban emissions scenarios in green growth-oriented contexts with and without local ambitions. These scenarios are further coupled with improvements in existing land use efficiencies and multi-dimensional analyses. The method is applied to 45 urban areas, including 15 cities that are selected as Mission Cities in Europe. Different urban emissions scenarios indicate possibilities for reducing 135.80 & PLUSMN; 0.87 MtCO2eq of annual urban consumptionbased emissions in 2020 by 58.72 MtCO2eq in 2030 along a 100% renewable energy pathway. Urban land use efficiency scenarios are used to determine annual carbon dioxide sequestration penalties that range between 8.25 and 14.95 MtCO2 in 2050 due to more built-up area in local biomes. Monte Carlo simulations support the analyses of urban emissions and sequestration penalties on a cumulative basis. Among illustrative scenario combinations, net cumulative urban emissions are 1725.93 MtCO2eq in the most favourable scenario that is 50.6% lower than those in the least favourable scenario. Multi-dimensional analyses based on a city index for benchmarking indicate an average improvement of 11.500 for Mission Cities with the quickest response for mitigation. The results have implications for guiding bold policy action and integrated urban planning to increase mitigation efforts for climate neutrality and sustainability.

AB Urban metabolism (UM) resembles the metabolism of living organisms in a community context by consuming necessities and excreting waste. Exercising UM with a circular economy concept enhances sustainable practices by circulating energy and materials, minimizing and closing waste loops to push a system for a net-zero goal. This research tracks energy and material flows in the energy, food waste, and construction materials sectors of Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, serving as a case study for campus metabolism. These three sectors are the top emitters and are interconnected at the food-water-energy nexus in terms of emissions. In addition to the flow analysis, the study includes environmental and economic evaluations of the proposed digestate composting and estimation of embodied emissions for construction material building stocks. The results suggest that Cornell needs to transition from natural gas to geothermal for a rapid shift towards renewable energy and to increase circularity within the sector. Regarding food waste, the proposed digestate composting reduces emissions by 16-39 metric tons of CO2e with a financial gain of US$90 k to US$400 k per fiscal year compared to the traditional food waste composting practice. Lastly, the proportional evaluation between operational emissions from the energy sector and embodied emissions from stored building materials shows a decreasing trend in the contribution of operational emissions from 46.42% to 26.86% in 2008 and 2021, respectively. This result highlights the immediate need for Cornell's construction waste management to prevent future emissions of embodied carbon into the environment. The campus metabolism study advances our understanding of potential energy and material flows, along with emissions offsets, among the three sectors to achieve the goal of decarbonization. This study can unlock sustainability pathways and accelerate Cornell's progress toward carbon neutrality by 2035.

AB The increasing energy demand in harbour areas, coupled with the need to reduce pollutant emissions, has led to the development of renewable energy-based polygeneration systems to face the carbon footprint of ports and ships at berth. In this way, in the coming years, ports can be converted into modern energy hubs. From this point of view, this paper presents a new dynamic simulation model for assessing and optimizing the energy and economic impact of ports. Here, energy systems and renewable sources can be designed to be connected to national electricity and natural gas grids and can include also alternative fuels (hydrogen, biomethane, etc.) and thermal energy networks, as well as different biomass fluxes (to be exploited for energy aims). Energy availability/demands of near towns and port buildings/infrastructures, as well as on-shore power supply are also included in the dynamic assessments. Hourly weather data and different prices for all the considered energy carriers are taken into account hour by hour. A multi-objective optimization approach is also implemented in the model considering energy and economic indexes to be optimized. The whole model is implemented in a computer tool written in MATLAB. For showing the capability of the developed model, a novel case study referred to the port of Naples (SouthItaly) is presented. Here, several renewable energy sources are considered, including an anaerobic biodigester for producing biogas from the organic waste of docked cruise ships. A combined heat and power system (fed by biogas) is implemented in the port energy hub also for supplying absorption chillers. PV panels, and marine power generators are also included. In the conducted analysis, optimization targets are the maximization of system self-consumption and self-sufficiency as well as the minimum simple payback period. The proposed system can effectively contribute to the decarbonization of the port energy demand and reduce harmful pollutant emissions. Results showed that very high rate of renewable energy produced on-site can be exploited (up to 84%) by the considered port facilities, ensuring increasing independency from utility power grid (self-sufficiency index up to 40%). By the obtained results and through the developed simulation/optimization tool, novel design and operating criteria can be achieved for future port energy hubs featured by renewables and bi-directional energy exchange between ships and port.

AB This paper investigates biomass and solar energy's present and future perspectives in low/zero energy and carbon emissions. Its data source is published articles indexed in the Scopus database. By analyzing the articles extracted in Vos viewer software, four main areas of research are found: sustainable development, economic and managerial issues, methods, algorithms, modeling technologies, and renewable energy and its sources and types. In all four sections, research gaps were observed in the field of the third generation of photovoltaics (semi-transparent solar cells )organic)) and algae. As part of the study, advanced bibliometric analysis was carried out by VOS viewer software, and 34129 articles were examined from Scopus, alongside a patent analysis using Google patents, in addition to the bibliometric analysis. It has been shown by machine learning that about 9% of future articles in all energy fields will consist of building articles, and a quarter of these articles will be in the field of renewable energy. While residential and commercial sectors are the dominant areas of renewable energy utilization and commercialization research, the potential of new generations of renewable energy technologies will create significant opportunities to achieve low/zero energy-carbon emission buildings. The paper concludes by predicting the increasing rate of renewable energy and building articles compared to energy articles by 2030, emphasizing the critical role of research in advancing sustainable energy solutions. This data mining analysis helps to identify the current gaps and opportunities. Therefore, great potential will be created to develop and commercialize a new generation of technologies in this industry.

AB The urgency of addressing climate change is increasingly evident through the rise in devastating natural disasters and significant shifts in global temperatures. With the urbanization of rural landscapes to accommodate population growth, the built environment has emerged as a major contributor to climate change, accounting for approximately 40% of natural resource consumption and carbon emissions. In pursuit of tackling climate challenges, countries have united under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to develop strategies for climate action and adaptation, through the Conference of the Parties (COP). The UAE has been an active member of the COP and has been at the forefront of implementing decarbonization strategies. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the decarbonization recommendations presented during COP26 and COP27, specifically focusing on the built environment sector. The primary objective is to highlight how recommendations were effectively incorporated into the UAE's built environment sector, employing a case study approach further highlighting the specific implementation strategies adopted in the G+2 SEE Institute building while demonstrating how COP26, COP27, and the UAE's National Climate Change Plan 2017-2050 recommendations were translated into practical measures. The study places particular emphasis on the areas of energy, water and waste management, investigating how these strategies were integrated to promote decarbonization efforts. By examining the G+2 SEE Institute building case, this research attempts to provide valuable insights on aligning built environment practices with climate change mitigation objectives. The planning of the building structure employed a systems thinking approach, while assessments were conducted to identify materials and designs that would enable the building to achieve net-zero status. Real-time data analysis was employed for comprehensive analysis. The findings of this study will contribute to the body of knowledge on sustainable construction practices and serve as a guide for stakeholders, including developers, policymakers, and practitioners, in adopting effective strategies in reducing carbon emissions and fostering environmental sustainability in line with the Paris Agreement.

AB Assessing and reducing the whole-life carbon emissions (WLCE) of buildings is essential to achieving global climate targets. Although many studies have examined building WLCE, there is a lack of understanding of the variability of WLCE for a large number of similar buildings in proximity and the key influencing factors. We fill these knowledge gaps by quantifying the WLCE of 145 residential properties in Cornwall, UK, following methods recommended in official standards and guidelines for building WLCE and using actual electricity consumption recorded by sensors, and then analysing correlations between the WLCE and a range of factors related to the properties and their occupants. We found significant variations in the WLCE among these 145 properties, ranging from 21 to 193 t CO2eq, with the WLCE intensity ranging from 0.5 to 2.6 t CO2eq/m2. There are strong correlations between WLCE and two factors: floor area and number of occupants, followed by number of bedrooms, type of property, window frame material, type of heating system, age of the main occupant, type of glazing, and loft insulation thickness. This suggests that both building attributes and occupant characteristics can result in significant variations in the WLCE of similar buildings in proximity. Therefore, both building design and occupant lifestyle need to be considered when developing strategies to reduce building WLCE.

AB Carbon emissions from building operations have a critical impact on achieving carbon peaking goal in China. However, the provincial emission performance in building operations are quite different and it is still uniden-tified how they affect the national emission change and peaking target, making national emission reduction target hard to implement at the provincial level. This paper explores the driving factors leading to emission changes and examines the prospective emission peaks in China and China's provinces by adopting generalized Divisia index method (GDIM) and the combination of scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Further-more, the regional emission heterogeneity and the contribution of provinces to the change and peak of national emissions are discussed to identify regions and provinces that should be focused on emission monitoring. Results show that in China and most Chinese provinces, energy consumption of commercial buildings, energy con-sumption and floor space of urban residential buildings besides income improvement, and the per capita CO2 emissions of rural residential buildings contributed greatly to emission growth. Under current policies, com-mercial and urban residential buildings in most provinces would fail to reach their emission peaks ahead of schedule. The urban residential buildings in the northern region, commercial and rural residential buildings in the eastern region caused higher CO2 emissions. At the provincial level, Shandong, Shanxi and Hebei made the top contribution to total emissions of commercial, urban residential and rural residential buildings, respectively. Shandong and the provinces in north China of urban residential buildings and four provinces including Shan-dong, Guangdong, Hebei and Zhejiang of commercial and rural residential buildings had the significant impact on the uncertainty of the peaking time of CO2 emissions. These findings provide a strong decision-making reference for Chinese government to formulate targeted regional emission reduction policies in building operations.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation in the residential building sector has become critical for China in achieving its carbon peak and neutrality goals. This study is the first to retrospect the historical carbon reduction potential in China's 30 provinces by establishing an equity and efficiency coupling model and comparing the differences in carbon reduction potential under three scenarios: equity priority, efficiency priority scenario, and balance equity with efficiency. The core findings of this study reveal that: (1) China's total CO2 emissions in residential buildings increased from 975.67 Mt to 1328.47 Mt during 2010-2020, where the provinces with the highest CO2 emissions are Shandong, Hebei, and Henan; energy intensity and energy carbon emission coefficient are the most critical driving factors affecting the CO2 emission, followed by floor area per capita and population size. (2) The carbon reduction potential index of residential buildings in eastern provinces is generally higher than that in western provinces; the growth rate of carbon reduction potential is the fastest under the equity priority scenario, and Beijing, Shanghai, and Inner Mongolia have the highest carbon reduction potential. (3) The provinces gradually enter a strong coupling status associated with the climate zones of residential buildings, while the coupling status of the urban area is higher than that of the rural area. Overall, this study adopts a new coupling perspective of equity and efficiency, where the proposed assessment model serves as a reference for measuring the retrospective CO2 mitigation effect in residential buildings in other countries.

AB As a gathering place for human production activities, cities are the main places where energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions occur. How to accurately measure city size and test the impact mechanism of city size on carbon emissions of different city levels is still controversial. This study uses the global nighttime light data to identify urban bright areas and built-up areas, and accordingly constructs the city size index of 259 prefecture level cities in China from 2003 to 2019. It avoids the problem of only considering the single index of population size or space size, and makes the measurement of city size more reasonable. We use a dynamic panel model to study the impact of city size on urban carbon emissions per capita, and discuss the heterogeneity of various cities under different population levels and economic development levels. The empirical results indicate that in the scale of cities in China showed a fluctuating growth trend in recent years. The city size index of most cities is clustered at medium and high values. The city size index of cities with different economic development levels and different population-scale levels shows obvious gradient differences but maintains an upward trend. The expansion of supercities (with a population of more than 5 million) introduces a drastic increase in carbon emissions. The carbon emissions growth caused by the expansion of cities that are classified as third tier and below is the smallest, while that caused by the expansion of cities that are classified as first-tier is the largest. The findings suggest differentiated emissions reduction suggestions for cities with different sizes.

   upfront emissions
AB Buildings are major contributors of carbon emissions and related global warming. Emissions occur along all building stages, from a whole-life perspective, including material production, construction processes, building operations, maintenance and end-of-life processes. Upfront emissions include processes before building operations. They can be influenced immediately and will have a positive effect today. However, mitigation potentials during the construction stage are often overseen in research. This study presents an analysis of the carbon emissions of 61 Danish construction sites based on their energy consumption, waste production (module A5) and transport to site (A4). The results show carbon emissions for A4 of 0.28 and for A5 of 1.00 kgCO(2)e/m(2) gross floor area per year over 50 years. This is 13.47% of the Danish whole-life carbon reference of 9.50 kgCO(2)e/m(2)y, which includes the product stage (A1-3), replacements (B4), operational energy use (B6) and waste processes and disposal (C3-4). Almost half of the emissions are related to construction waste followed by electricity, heat and fuel. Floor area and building use have not shown to be influential for carbon emissions, suggesting other parameters are more important. The significance of modules A4 and A5 suggests implementing them in future whole-life carbon assessments and related policies. This paper also demonstrates the development of generic emission coefficients, which are suited to increase the feasibility for application in the building industry. Finally, the usability of module A4 and A5 in environmental product declarations is discussed.

ID WEATHER DATA; IMPACTS; SIMULATION
AB The building sector is facing a challenge in achieving carbon neutrality due to climate change and urbanization. Urban building energy modeling (UBEM) is an effective method to understand the energy use of building stocks at an urban scale and evaluate retrofit scenarios against future weather variations, supporting the implementation of carbon emission reduction policies. Currently, most studies focus on the energy performance of archetype buildings under climate change, which is hard to obtain refined results for individual buildings when scaling up to an urban area. Therefore, this study integrates future weather data with an UBEM approach to assess the impacts of climate change on the energy performance of urban areas, by taking two urban neighborhoods comprising 483 buildings in Geneva, Switzerland as case studies. In this regard, GIS datasets and Swiss building norms were collected to develop an archetype library. The building heating energy consumption was calculated by the UBEM tool-AutoBPS, which was then calibrated against annual metered data. A rapid UBEM calibration method was applied to achieve a percentage error of 2.7%. The calibrated models were then used to assess the impacts of climate change using four future weather datasets out of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). The results showed a decrease of 22%-31% and 21%-29% for heating energy consumption, an increase of 113%-173% and 95%-144% for cooling energy consumption in the two neighborhoods by 2050. The average annual heating intensity dropped from 81 kWh/m(2) in the current typical climate to 57 kWh/m(2) in the SSP5-8.5, while the cooling intensity rose from 12 kWh/m(2) to 32 kWh/m(2). The overall envelope system upgrade reduced the average heating and cooling energy consumption by 41.7% and 18.6%, respectively, in the SSP scenarios.

AB Mitigating CO2 emissions for space heating (SH) and hot water (HW) preparation in buildings is key to reaching climate protection targets. In this context, it is important to understand meaningful balances between CO2 reduction through thermal renovation activities and the change of heating systems. In this work, we develop cost-optimal balances for different system settings with the Invert/Opt model. This model optimises the measures applied in each building so that the system costs for SH and HW preparation are minimised under given constraints for a given country. About 500-1000 options are considered for each building. We calculate scenarios and sensitivities for all countries of EU-27, reflecting a 95% reduction in CO2 emissions for SH and HW with a mix of direct and indirect RES technologies. These differ in the settings related to the applicability and costs of building-shell-related measures and the costs and availability of resource potentials. The results show that probably a high share of thermal renovation on total upcoming refurbishment activities until 2050 is cost-efficient to reach a 95% CO2 reduction in the EU-27 building stocks. Assuming that up to 90% of the buildings in each EU-27 country is applicable for a thermal renovation in case a refurbishment activity is needed leads to around 4% lower system costs by 2050 (13 billion EUR/year) compared to assuming a maximum share of 35%. Energy needs are reduced on average more in older buildings than in newer buildings. Nonetheless, a combination of thermal renovation and heating system change is often the most cost-effective option to reduce system-wide CO2 emissions also in more recent buildings. The calculations lead to cost-optimal savings in final energy demand in the range of 29-47% between 2019 and 2050. Assuming less favourable conditions for thermal renovation (high capital recovery expectations, additional technical barriers and high availability of cheap fuels) the cost-optimal level of heat savings in buildings for overall EU-27 could be suspected at around 1/3 down to 1/4 of current final energy demand.

AB The increasing trend towards decarbonization requires the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector that currently accounts for approximately 40% of the total CO2 emissions of European countries. Even though Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC) panels could be a very promising technology to be installed in urban environments, there is still little implementation of LSC panels in building facades. Here, the realization of a Ventilated Facade (VF) integrating an LSC device as an external pane is presented and a preliminary numerical and experimental investigation is used to evaluate the interaction between the different structure components. Thanks to the realization of a dedicated mock-up finite element method, models are calibrated and validated against experimental measurements, showing a good correspondence between simulated and measured data. Moreover, the electrical characterization of the LSC panel confirms that large area devices can be used as an external skin of VF, reporting a photovoltaic efficiency of 0.5%. The system's thermal and optical properties (estimated thanks to the software COMSOL Multiphysics) encourage the continuation of the research by considering different technologies for the VF internal skin, by scaling up the case study, and by running the simulation of an entire building considering winter and summer energy demands.

AB More than half of the world population live in urban settlements which are responsible for a large share of energy consumption and, consequently, carbon emissions. The transition towards a more sustainable urban environment requires a change in paradigm in terms of how we design and manage our cities. Urban areas require innovative technologies and strategies to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, and to be included in comprehensive plans encompassing all technical, social and economic dimensions which characterise cities. This involves the transformation of urban contexts, with a focus on local and urban-level mitigation measures, such as the construction of positive energy buildings, deployment of renewable energy, promotion of a sustainable mobility, creation of resilient urban infrastructure, implementation of circular economy and recycling practices, etc. The present article provides a perspective on the sustainable energy transition in cities, focusing on the building and transportation sectors. Furthermore, insights on supporting mechanisms and innovative management strategies are presented.

AB Symbiotic consistency among several limited resources has become increasingly prominent. Dependence on fossil fuels, combined with energy consumption-induced water scarcity and excess carbon emissions, jeopardizes sustainable development. This study developed a provincial-scale energy substitution and response (ESR) model to (a) aggregate homogeneous regions and emphasize consistency of results; (b) formulate energy-substitution strategies based on ecological utility maximization; (c) explore responses from the threefold perspective of environmental improvement, economic utility, and system robustness; and (d) reveal the effects of the main factors and their interactions to support policymaking. An approach that combines the k-means algorithm, multiregional input-output analysis, ecological network analysis, and factorial analysis was applied to China to verify the models. It was found that the uneven transfer of interregional ecological flows across regions is not conducive to the health of metabolic mechanisms. Energy substitution can bring the multiple benefits of resource conservation, environmental improvement, profit growth, and sustainability enhancement. Regions I, IV, and V can take the lead in implementing substitutions while Regions II and III can adopt a joint substitution strategy to obtain compound effects. Natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas facilities should be built in more developed regions while clean energy subsidies should be supplemented in underdeveloped areas. This study's findings offer a new perspective for coordinating environmental, economic, and social development while avoiding high unemployment and regional population loss caused by energy system restructuring.

AB Existing buildings are a source of great potential for energy efficiency through renovation. In this study, the national energy requirements equivalent for the major renovation of existing non-residential buildings using the example of office buildings in five European case countries are drawn out and discussed. The non-residential building sector has been found to be complex and heterogenous with much less available data than for the residential sector, but having greater average specific energy consumption per floor area. The existing non-residential building stock in the studied countries has been divided into varying amounts of groups and sub-groups. The energy requirements have been shifting from the increasing requirements for the U-values of the building envelope (before the 2000s) towards calculated energy demand for buildings as a whole (currently). The requirements for buildings in the near future will be carbon emission based. The energy efficiency of N-RBs in all of the studied case countries have been steadily improved during different decades of construction. Relatively older office stock combined with the relatively late introduction of national energy requirements was found to have a significantly larger potential for energy savings. Different terms and contents in national requirements were used to describe the principles of "major renovation" as from EPBD.

AB Rapid electrification of buildings at the district scale is needed for cities to achieve climate change mitigation goals. However, most electrification studies focus on either the single building level or the city/region building stock level, and depend on the slow and uncertain process of requesting personally identifiable customer energy usage data from utilities. To answer a key question facing local policymakers: "Where can electrification proceed at scale without first upgrading the grid?" this study aims to quantify and inform building electrification impacts at the district scale using detailed building energy modeling and based on public records datasets. We explore how energy efficiency retrofits can help mitigate increased peak electric demand, and quantify impacts to energy use and carbon emissions. Building energy models of a baseline, and scenarios of simple electrification, energy retrofits, and electrification in combination with retrofits were created and simulated for 54 commercial buildings in two contiguous districts of San Francisco. A simple electrification scenario increased annual electricity consumption but reduced annual site energy usage by 15% to 17%, mainly due to replacing inefficient gas furnaces and boilers with more efficient heat pumps. Peak demand increased 7.4% for Fisherman's Wharf (e.g. within the capacity of the existing power grid), while the Design District showed a marginal decrease. Annual carbon emissions were reduced by 46% and 37%. Combining electrification with efficiency upgrades reduced peak demand by 26% and 40%, and annual carbon emissions by 63% and 64% for the two districts. These results indicate that impacts of electrification depend on the mix of building uses within a district, and coupling electrification with energy efficiency upgrades is an effective strategy to decarbonize buildings while maintaining or reducing the peak electric demand.

AB To reduce carbon emissions, holistic approaches to design, plan, and build our environment are needed. Regarding multi-story residential buildings, it is well-known that (1) material choices and construction typologies play a fundamental role in the reduction of carbon footprint, (2) shifting from concrete to timber will reduce significantly the carbon footprint, and (3) a building designed to be disassembled will increase the potential of achieving zero-carbon emissions. However, little has been said about the consequences of such shifts and decisions in terms of building architecture and structural design, especially in seismic-prone regions. In this study, an existing 9-story reinforced concrete (RC) multi-story residential building is redesigned with cross-laminated timber floors and glue-laminated timber frames for embodied carbon reduction purposes. Firstly, the reasons behind design decisions are addressed in terms of both architecture and structure, including the incorporation of specially steel concentrically braced frames for seismic-resistance. Then, the outcomes of life cycle assessments and pushover analyses show that the RC residential building emits two times more carbon than the hybrid steel-timber residential building, and that while the hybrid building's lateral load-capacity is less than in the RC building, its deformation capacity is higher. These results highlight the relevance of considering the carbon footprint in combination with the design decisions, which seems to be the key to introducing circular projects in seismic-prone areas.

AB Based on the combination of gas engine cogeneration of heat and power (GECHP) technology and temperature and humidity independent control air-conditioning technology, an air-conditioning system combined with desiccant wheel driven by GECHP was proposed to decrease cooling energy consumption and utilize the waste heat of gas engine. In this study, Dymola software was adopted to model the hybrid system and conduct hourly simulation throughout the cooling and heating season for two types of large public buildings: the supermarket building and the office building. Results show that the hybrid system applied to target buildings can meet the requirements of each index of air-conditioning energy supply. Comparing two types of application scenarios, the system primary energy conversion ratio of the supermarket building reaches 112%, 19% higher than that of the office building. And the system CO2 emission reduction rate per unit of capacity of the supermarket building is 0.18 kg/kWh, lower than the 0.22 kg/kWh of the office building. Therefore, the hybrid system has superior energy-saving and environmental performance and is especially suitable for high-temperature and high-humidity areas in summer as well as building application scenarios with high indoor moisture gain and fresh air demand.

AB Humans emit carbon dioxide (CO2) as a product of their metabolism. No measurements of CO2 emission rates (CERs) of elderly sleeping people have yet been reported. This study performed such measurements and examined the possible mechanisms impacting CERs. Sixteen participants (8 males) aged >= 65 years old slept alone for a whole night under each of the four conditions in a 2 x 2 design: air temperatures of 27 degrees C and 30 degrees C and ventilation rates of 5 m3/h per person and 28 m3/h per person (resulting in an average indoor CO2 concentration of about 1200 ppm and 760 ppm, respectively). Physiological responses were recorded during sleep. Indoor parameters including CO2 concentration were continuously measured during and after sleep period. The CERs were calculated using a mass-balance model. The results show that the average CER was 9.0 +/- 1.6 L/h per person. It was ca. 20% higher for males than for females, probably due to higher body mass, body surface area, and longer time awake during sleep. Compared with 27 degrees C, the CER was about 10% higher at 30 degrees C probably due to longer time awake and higher heart rate and skin temperature at this condition. No significant differences in CERs were observed between the two ventilation rates. The CERs measured in the present study for elderly are slightly lower than recently reported for young adults and 10-12 year old children. They all provide information required for estimating ventilation rates in bedrooms assuming that the ventilation is achieved with clean outdoor air.

AB The construction of transformer substations in transmission lines is a systematic, technical, and complex project with the need for numerous materials and resources. Under the development of the green economy, the requirements for energy conservation and carbon reduction have improved; hence, an assessment of carbon emissions in transformer substations is urgently needed. A calculation method was proposed in the present study to analyze the carbon emissions of transformer substations with different kinds of data sources, which were collected from several practical projects in the west-to-east power transmission project. In this study, a detailed comparison and discussion regarding the differences in carbon emissions of 750 kV transformer substations caused by hydrology, geology, engineering quantity, and other factors were conducted. The mean value, standard deviation, and 90% confidence interval of carbon emissions were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation through MATLAB. Results show that the total carbon emissions of the selected 750 kV transformer substations are between [56,000, 68,000] t CO2 eq. Construction engineering accounts for more than 50% of carbon emissions, followed by installation engineering and additional services. In terms of input items, electricity distribution buildings contribute more than 39% of total carbon emissions, followed by cable/earthing systems, which account for 14% of total carbon emissions. Gas insulated switchgear (GIS) and air insulated switchgear (AIS) could adopt different types of equipment foundations, and GIS equipment foundations would generate fewer carbon emissions due to the smaller land area and input materials. This study can provide experience and reference for similar projects and further guide the substation carbon emission reduction work.

AB Ever since European Directive 2012/27/EU, particular attention has been focused on the improvement of the energy efficiency of the public building stock. According to the directive, local public authorities, regions and municipalities, are expected to develop and implement energy efficiency retrofitting plans for their public building stocks. While conducting such plans, important challenges are raised mainly related to data collection and the manipulation of key performance indicators (KPIs) for many buildings. The present paper deals with the aforementioned challenges through (a) the evaluation of freely available tools developed in the framework of Mediterranean territorial cooperation projects, with respect to the main pillars of energy efficiency planning, and (b) the introduction of a stepwise methodology using selected tools toward a reliable energy efficiency plan extending from the classification of the building stock to the prioritization of projects in terms of a gradual renovation plan based on energy and cost criteria. The methodology is applied for a case study in Greece, which refers to 10 public buildings of the Municipality of Aigialeia in Greece. A reliable renovation plan is developed, taking into account the municipal authority's directions in a specialized decision-making scheme. It is concluded that the suggested methodology is very practical for planning purposes, while for the case studied, a 6-year gradual renovation plan is emerged until a deep retrofit of all buildings, associated with an estimated primary energy saving and CO2 emissions avoidance of more than 1850 MWh and 400 tns, respectively, with a total investment of about EUR 3 million.

AB The integration of solar energy with biomass gasification combined cooling, heating and power (BGCCHP) system is performed. The solar-assisted hybrid BGCCHP (SAHB) system following electricity load (FEL) and following thermal load (FTL) is optimized to maximize its energetic, economic and environmental benefits in comparison with typical separated production (TSP) system. Based on a hotel building in Beijing, the optimal configuration and performance of the SAHB system fueled by corn straw (CS), rice straw (RS), wood pellet (WP) and wheat straw (WS) are obtained. Results show that the annual primary energy consumption saving ratio (APECSR), annual total cost saving ratio (ATCSR), annual carbon dioxide emission reduction ratio (ACDERR) and comprehensive saving ratio (CSR) are from 92.60% to 123.57%, from 29.39% to 52.75%, from 92.15% to 132.37% and from 72.49% to 102.90%, respectively, which indicates that the SAHB system performs better in energetic, economic, environmental and comprehensive aspects compared with TSP system. The area of photovoltaic panel (PVP) is recommended to be 880.40 m2, i.e., the available roof area, which means that PVP is more conducive to improving the system performance compared with solar thermal collector (STC). The SAHB system operating under FTL is superior to that operating under FEL because more electricity is sold back to the electricity grid when the SAHB system operates under FTL. Among the biomass materials, CS yields the best energetic, economic, environmental and comprehensive performance. Under FEL, the CSR of CS is 3.28%, 0.90% and 2.84% larger than that of RS, WS and WP, respectively. Under FTL, the CSR of CS is 4.25%, 1.17% and 3.18% larger than that of RS, WS and WP, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that biomass price and gasification efficiency have the most significant impact on the system performance under FEL and FTL, respectively. When the biomass price of CS increases by 10.00%, the CSR under FEL decreases by 1.28%. On the contrary, the CSR under FTL increases by 1.88% when the gasification efficiency of CS increases by 10.00%.

AB Since 2017, the "Clean Heating Plan" policy has effectively improved the environmental quality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, Northern China. However, the heating system retrofitted rural resi-dences are facing new issues, such as indoor thermal discomfort and a significant increase in heating costs, due to the poor insulation performance of the building envelope. On the premise of reducing envi-ronmental impact, the lifecycle cost-effectiveness of retrofit solutions for improving indoor thermal com-fort has become a critical issue. This study establishes a trade-off framework for carbon emissions, indoor thermal comfort, and global cost under different scenarios (e.g., low-carbon and zero-carbon) using the SPEA2 algorithm. This framework consists of four sections: the establishment of a prototypical model based on field investigation data, the variable filtering based on global sensitivity analysis, the multi-objective optimisation of retrofitting measures, and the final decision-making based on the Utopian point method. The final optimal solutions indicated that: under a low-carbon scenario, the carbon emission of Type I (air-source heat pump) and II (natural gas heater) models are decreased by 61.10% and 56.81%, the indoor thermal discomfort time rates are decreased by 13.55% and 19.83%, and the global cost increment is decreased by 1.94% and 20.30%, respectively. Under a zero-carbon scenario, the carbon emission of Type I and II models are decreased by 90.89% and 79.54%, the indoor thermal discomfort time rate is decreased by 24.66% and 23.15%, whereas the global cost increment is increased by 158.57% and 45.82%, respectively. The proposed framework could be widely used as an accurate and feasible tool in the improvement of the environment and human habitat in rural areas in northern China.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Research studies have recently diverted attention towards the determinant of ecological footprints, but related issues have not provided consistent results. Based on the IPAT model (environmental impact (I) is decomposed into three elements: population (P), affluence (A, economic growth), and technology level (T)), this paper empirically explores the validity of the green information and communication technology (GICT)-induced environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The research applies a quantile regression (QR) that tests over 95 countries' panel data for the period 2000-2017 by using six types of ecological footprint (EF) as environmental degradation indicators and environmental regulations (ERs) as interaction variables. We confirm the vital role that GICT plays in lessening cropland, forest area, and grazing land, while increasing its impact on built-up land. Additionally, the findings partially support the existence of an inverted U-shaped GICT-induced environmental EKC hypothesis for a decreasing impact on cropland, forest area, and grazing land via consideration of non-market-based ER as the interaction term. GICT does not notably reduce carbon-absorption land usage; however, improvements of GICT and non-market-based ER in those nations have been accompanied by lower environmental degradation.

AB Biomass sources have the potential to mitigate carbon emissions as a renewable source while reducing waste and residues. Seasonality and disruption risks are some of the disadvantages of biomass resources requiring that biomass supply chains be managed such that to withstand disruptions. There has been very limited research on integrating predictions for smart management on supply or demand sides of biomass supply chains. In this study, a number of predictive models are investigated for building energy demand and biomass stock availability subject to forecasts of weather conditions. On that basis, an allocation algorithm is proposed for optimal collection and logistics of biomass from land to depots. Accordingly, Google Maps API will be used to identify the best distribution routes for delivering biomass from depots to end-users. A case study with real (supply and demand) data is considered. The proposed integrated data-driven approach aims at improving the accuracy of biomass supply and demand predictions and coordinating these predictions to enhance the resiliency of bioenergy supply chain routing decisions.

ID PRINCIPLES; MIXES
AB Given the significance of carbon emissions from the existing building stock, this paper aims to provide an in-ternational comparative analysis of pioneering policies on minimum energy efficiency standards in the Scottish, English/Welsh, Dutch and French commercial real estate sectors. These are the four national policy regimes to employ these policy instruments to date with varied timelines spanning from 2009 to 2050. The methodological approach employs a document review of policy texts produced by policy makers and other stakeholders. The four policy regimes are evaluated in terms of their policy design focussing on minimum performance standards, forward guidance, scope and exemptions. A key finding is that, given the range of intervening factors, side-effects and uncertainties, there are difficult choices in striking a balance between phasing implementation, providing forward guidance and adjusting policy in response to evaluation. Whilst it was initially expected that most European Union jurisdictions would default to an Energy Performance Certificate related standard, our findings show that there has been a shift towards standards that are linked to actual rather than modelled energy con-sumption. However, for leased stock where the owner may have limited operational control, the separation of owners' responsibility for compliance and the users' responsibility for operations makes designing consumption -based instruments more challenging. It is concluded that a central issue in policy design has been the trade-off between minimising the financial costs to property owners and occupiers of complying with performance thresholds and maximising reductions in energy consumption. There is growing recognition that regulatory economies of scale may be achieved by targeting large properties which allows for a large proportion of the total area of the stock to be covered whilst exempting a large proportion of transactions or properties.

AB Net-zero climate districts are gaining wide attention at the European and international levels. Urban regeneration competitions have been launched recently to stimulate development; nevertheless, the literature does not yet provide a shared scope definition (i.e., product system). Using the process-based life cycle assessment method, the authors evaluate the climate profile of a new district in Milan (14 buildings with 36,000 m(2) of gross surface area in total) aiming to become the first net-zero social housing project in Italy. The authors show in the results section how climate neutrality is achieved on the part of the real estate operator by varying the scope. The most conservative scenario (including all the emission sources considered in the analysis) indicates that the net-zero climate target is reached only by purchasing voluntary carbon credits. The authors also highlight: (i) a district composed of nearly-zero energy buildings is far from the definition of a net-zero climate emissions district; (ii) a net-zero climate emissions district may not be a positive energy district and vice-versa; and (iii) constraints linked with the lack of space in a densely populated city due to insufficient area to install renewables on site.

AB Energy benchmarking in buildings is a significant analytical method to determine and classify the energy performance of buildings. The objective of the present paper is to establish a compre-hensive data-driven energy benchmark model for banking buildings. In this context, 587 bank branches are selected to cover every climatic region in Turkey, with more than 210,000 data obtained from the installed energy analyzers and building energy audits. A mathematical model is developed and verified to define the EUI of the existing bank branches. Calculated energy scores and benchmark study implied an energy efficiency potential across the sector. Investigating the results of underperforming buildings, the building shell and construction date are found to be significant. As results indicated an efficiency potential, a scenario-based energy benchmark model is proposed based on the new insulation regulations in Turkey to see the possible energy con-sumption and carbon gas emission reductions. The developed model is adapted to the scenario -based model by revising U-values concerning the regulation and climate zones. The scenario -based strategy has led to a 2136.7 MWh/year reduction in energy consumption. The total EUI was found to decrease from 159.44 to 124.35 kWh/m2year, also resulting in a 20.5% improve-ment equal to 2057.3 equivalent tons of CO2/year in annual GHG emissions with the application of new regulations.

AB Buildings are an important part of society's environmental impacts, both in the construction and in the use phase. As the energy performance of buildings improve, construction materials become more important as a cause of environmental impact. Less attention has been given to those materials. We explore, as an alternative for conventional buildings, the use of biobased materials and circular building practices. In addition to building design, we analyze the effect of urbanization. We assess the potential to close material cycles together with the material related impact, between 2018 and 2050 in the Netherlands. Our results show a limited potential to close material cycles until 2050, as a result of slow stock turnover and growth of the building stock. At present, end-of-life recycling rates are low, further limiting circularity. Primary material demand can be lowered when shifting toward biobased or circular construction. This shift also reduces material related carbon emissions. Large-scale implementation of biobased construction, however, drastically increases land area required for wood production. Material demand differs strongly spatially and depends on the degree of urbanization. Urbanization results in higher building replacement rates, but constructed dwellings are generally small compared to scenarios with more rural developments. The approach presented in this work can be used to analyze strategies aimed at closing material cycles in the building sector and lowering buildings' embodied environmental impact, at different spatial scales.

AB The steel industry is a major contributor to emissions of CO2 and key air pollutants. Reducing air pollution has since long been a policy priority in China. Reducing CO2 emissions has more recently also become a key priority partially manifested through the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. Although there are often synergies between reducing CO2 emissions and air pollution, it may have implications for the geographical location if one is prioritized over the other, with subsequent effects on local economies and overall policy efficiency. Therefore, we build a top-down optimization model to assess the provincial allocation of steel production, air pollution impact and the cost for meeting the target of peaking CO2 emissions in 2025 and reducing them by 30% in 2030. This short-term reduction target can be regarded as the first steps for China's steel industry to meet the national net zero target and the Pairs agreement. We analyze a scenario to minimize air pollution impact and compare this with a scenario to minimize CO2 mitigation costs. The results show that it is possible to peak CO2 emissions in 2025 and reduce them by 30% in 2030 but the resulting scrap demand requires increased quality scrap collection or imports. The total cost for different scenarios is similar but optimizing on abatement cost leads to lower cumulative CO2 emissions 2021-2030 compared to optimizing on pollution impact. If reducing pollution impact is the main objective, it leads to 22-26% lower pollution impact than when optimizing on abatement costs, and less primary production in densely populated areas. This implies that policy must handle trade-offs between cost optimal mitigation and pollution impact, as well as effects on local economies. Policy must also balance the accelerated introduction of Electric Arc Furnaces while simultaneously reducing overcapacity in primary production.

AB The 2018/844 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU) has widened the scope of appropriate design of buildings from a pure energy performance and carbon emissions perspective to a wider scope that includes indoor comfort, and indoor air quality among others. To this effect, external parameters, especially solar energy, have a strong impact on the energy performance of buildings in Mediterranean regions, which requires careful consideration when it comes to benefiting from natural lighting while avoiding solar overheating. This paper addresses the considerations of natural lighting in the deep renovation of a housing block in the Mediterranean climate of the Republic of Malta, comparing some of the usual illuminance ranges to achieve optimal conditions based on international recommendations. DesignBuilder v7.0.0.102 has been the selected software to model the building that has been calibrated through experimental measurements. The model enabled the natural lighting conditions in the building evaluated and the effectiveness of suggested improvements to be determined. Results pointed out that the building under study satisfies the international standards about the prevention of visual discomfort only. Increasing the size of windows in identified zones, especially the first floor, was found to help improve other natural lighting characteristics. One of the proposed designs (Model 6) that replaces single-glazed with double-glazed windows that include an external spectrally-selective coating would significantly improve access to natural light bringing the building closer to the recommended levels of Annual Sunlight Exposure and reducing artificial lighting usage by up to five times. The relocation of room spaces could also reduce the use of artificial lighting.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Insulating external walls has great potential to reduce post-retrofit operational energy consumption and thus carbon emissions, but determination of the optimal insulation thickness still remains a challenge in the building industry. Although life cycle performance assessment has been introduced into the optimization of wall insu-lation thickness, there is still a lack of studies conducted at the building stock level. Moreover, the impact of variations of future climate conditions and the carbon intensity of the electricity grid are rarely studied. This study aims to fill this gap, by developing and demonstrating a holistic whole life approach to determine the optimized wall insulation thickness of the English housing stock. The study assesses both the reduced post -retrofit operational energy and carbon, as well as the additional embodied energy and carbon from wall insu-lation. There are three different optimization aims, namely: maximize the whole life carbon emissions reduction, maximize the whole life energy consumption reduction, and maximize both the whole life energy consumption and carbon emissions reduction. The results revealed that the optimized glass wool insulation thickness varies from 0.010 m to 0.275 m, increasing wall insulation thickness further than optimized value will result in negative effects. Ignoring future variations could lead to overestimation of the reduction potential of insulation instal-lation on whole life energy consumption, and thus emissions reduction. The overestimation percentage for stock level whole life energy consumption reduction varies from 20.5% to 26.7%, and the overestimation percentage for stock level whole life carbon emissions reduction varies from 421.3% to 502.0%.

AB Understanding factors influencing carbon emissions is important for achieving carbon abatement goals. Traditionally, decomposition approaches, e.g. Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method, are used to uncover factors influencing the change of carbon emissions. This study aims to develop a novel spatio-temporally stratified heterogeneity (STSH) model to better identify, analyze and understand influencing factors of carbon emissions. Compared with LMDI, this model can analyze more independent intensity and quantity factors and reveal the complex interactions between factors. Using China's construction industry as a case study, the model can successfully identify top influencing factors in the same order of importance similar to LMDI, although a significantly larger number of factors are considered. In the whole construction stage, cement usage, steel usage, completed floor area and construction output value have the highest contributions of 0.599, 0.528, 0.448, 0.446 respectively. In construction and construction-related transportation activities, the top influencing factors are fixed capital assets, con-struction output value, completed floor area, and electricity usage, with contributions of 0.632, 0.613, 0.599, and 0.597, respectively. The model can also reveal the complex interactions between factors, including bi-variate enhanced interaction and nonlinearly enhanced interaction. The results demonstrate that the model is more useful to evaluate the individual and aggregate impact of a large number of inde-pendent factors on carbon emissions when compared with previous models.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB The simultaneous escalation in energy consumption and greenhouse gases in the environment drives power generation to pursue a more sustainable path. Solar photovoltaic is one of the technologies identified as a possible source of clean, green, and affordable energy in the future. The vast land area occupied by solar photovoltaics to generate electricity suggests that large photovoltaic facilities be built on the water surface, serving the dual purpose of saving land, increasing efficiency and power output. Despite the remarkable geophysical conditions of India, the evaluation of floating solar photovoltaic power plants revealed little involvement in this technology. This research aims to offer a comprehensive technical and sustainable goal-based analysis to provide an efficient hybrid hydel-floating solar photovoltaic system. In this paper, an assessment of a 96 megawatt power plant is done to show the economic and ecological benefits of a floating solar photovoltaic system. A comparison of land-based photovoltaic, floating solar photovoltaic, and hybrid hydel-floating solar photovoltaic is done to check the cost-efficiency and sustainability. The result indicates that the floating solar photovoltaics system produces 81.39 gigawatt-hour excess generation with 2.4% more energy yield compared to the land-based photovoltaic system. The total water saved is 69.4 mcm. The equivalent carbon reduction is 123,454.53 tons of CO2. The levelized cost of energy generation is 3.23 $/W, which is 2.3% less than the current price of electricity. The floating solar photovoltaic help in achieving sustainable development goals along with the protection of the ecological system.

AB The paper presents original research, encompassing the results of analyses of modular building facade solutions, as well as innovative design concepts based on these results by students of the Faculty of Architecture at the Poznan University of Technology. Adapting architecture to climate change is the main objective behind research and innovative designs. Reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, thermal comfort of buildings, better thermal environment ergonomics for users of buildings' interiors, increased energy efficiency together with the use of renewable energy sources are major challenges for today's designers. Dealing with rainwater, wind and pressure changes are already absolute necessities. Contemporary trends in modern construction in urban areas were identified on the basis of results of analyses of selected existing buildings, presented using tables, graphs and statistical tools. Conclusions from the demonstrated correlations of quantitative data with social, economic and environmental factors became the basis for the students' conceptual assumptions. The selected innovative facade designs presented in the article demonstrate a variety of solutions for modern modular systems which protect buildings from excessive sun exposure, help insulation resist external factors, generate energy, ventilate buildings, use pressure differences, collect water, purify air, protect fauna, etc. As a result, the developed concepts may be indicative of a contemporary approach to sustainable building design, based not only on reducing any negative environmental impact and conserving natural resources, but also on designing aesthetic buildings based on classic notions of beauty.

AB UK schoolchildren spend on average 30% of their waking lives inside schools. While indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is critical for their health and attainment, school buildings are also a key part of the UK's carbon emissions reduction strategy. To address conflicts between energy efficiency and IEQ, predictive models of UK classroom stock should incorporate energy and IEQ performance criteria across dynamic scenarios comprising energy retrofit and IEQ improvement measures. On this basis, we have developed a novel approach for auto-generation, simulation, post-processing and analysis of EnergyPlus UK classroom archetype models. Such modelling fa-cilitates the multi-parameter evaluation of school building performance, whilst incorporating stock-wide heterogeneity and longitudinal dynamic changes. As extent of retrofit increases, decreasing incremental energy demand reduction was quantified and increasing effectiveness of passive ventilation at mitigating overheating was identified. Negative impact of South facing orientation on overheating was reduced after applying a range of IEQ improvement methods. However, low ceiling heights in 1945-1967 era classrooms impact the efficacy of these IEQ mitigations on calculated attainment, requiring design rather than mitigation strategies as a remedial solution. Strategies preventing NO2 pollution ingress could be more-effective than PM2.5, with night-time ventilation avoiding ingress during daily peaks and greater sensitivity to location. Future work shall incorporate multiple criteria into a single tool based on stakeholder preferences to improve quality of retrofit decision making.

AB The share of industry in final global energy consumption was more than 30% in 2020, of which, the hard-to-abate sectors accounted for almost 60% of total final consumption in industry. Similarly, in Europe, industry accounts for around 25% of final energy consumption. In order to reduce the impact of industry in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, Europe has set many policies that support and regulate the sector, including pricing carbon emissions in a cap-and-trade scheme called the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). According to the EU ETS, in 2021 the verified emissions of all stationary installations were around 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. In 2021, the total allocated allowances amounted to around 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, half of which were freely allocated. After reviewing the existing modeling approaches for industrial clusters and the available datasets, and assessing the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions at plant level using a geographical information system approach (GIS), a taxonomy for industrial cluster decarbonization was introduced. This taxonomy shows that describing industry as sets of clustered installations rather than based on the conventional sectoral economic classification provides more insights into energy transition. First, the cluster description provides a more accurate techno-economic assessment based on a finer characterization of economies of scale compared to traditional energy systems models. Second, the industrial clustering approach may more realistically show the feasibility, in addition to the costs and benefits from coupling industry with transport (e.g., industrial fleets and logistics) or buildings (e.g., city scale), due to a more detailed representation of the energy sources and sinks.

AB In Spain, 90% of companies are small- or medium-sized and are usually located in industrial areas, in warehouses with particular characteristics. This paper presents a methodology for the environmental assessment of this type of construction with water and carbon footprint indicators. A database was developed for the identification of typologies and common construction elements based on a sample of 87 projects in the province of Seville. Based on this, the paper proposes a methodology for comparative analysis that merges the data obtained from the research survey with environmental and economic data. The work proposes a systematic classification of the construction units of industrial buildings in order to improve the sustainability of the decision-making process by introducing environmental information on construction materials and machinery. First, the most impactful elements were identified, and then the technical solutions were adjusted using solutions already in the sample of 87 industrial projects. Reductions of up to 74% in the carbon footprint and 54% of the water footprint were found, as well as 14% reduction in construction costs in the most favorable case.

AB A carbon peak in 2030 and carbon neutrality in 2060 are major strategic development goals for China. Driven by the ambitious goal of achieving a carbon peak and carbon neutrality, the development of green innovation technology is an important method of achieving these aims. Speeding up energy transformation and tapping into the carbon sink capacity of the natural ecosystem are key to this process. The strategic path of green development deserves further discussion. This study takes Guizhou province as an example. Based on the actual situation of Guizhou province and the characteristics of karst areas, through the collection and collation of the existing literature, policies, and technologies and the analysis of typical cases, this paper summarizes and analyzes ecological restoration and negative carbon emissions in karst areas; water-energy-carbon coupling, energy saving, and emissions reduction technologies; industrial energy saving and emission-reduction technologies in karst areas; and CCUS technology for carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage. On this basis, the trend and orientation of green development in Guizhou are studied and judged, and countermeasures such as adhering to clean and efficient low-carbon utilization, strengthening the research on and development of carbon emission-reduction technology, and implementing carbon sink capacity buildings are put forward. Key core technology research and development innovation are recommended to establish a low-carbon science and technology innovation system. The efficient use of energy, the recycling of resources, negative emissions, and other strategies should be promoted. We also posit specific suggestions such as accelerating the transformation and application of green and low-carbon scientific and technological achievements.

AB The Smarter Together project implemented in the three lighthouse cities (LHCs) of Lyon, Munich, and Vienna a set of co-created and integrated smart solutions for a better life in urban districts. The implemented solutions have been monitored using a novel integrated monitoring methodology (IMM) following a co-creation process involving key stakeholders of the LHCs. With focus on holistic building refurbishment and the integration of onsite renewable energy supply (RES), the three LHCs refurbished around 117,497 m(2) of floor area and constructed 12,446 m(2) of new floor area. They implemented around 833 kWp of PV, 35 kW of solar thermal and 13,122 kW of geothermal heating systems. Altogether, the realized solutions for low-energy districts in the three LHCs will annually save around 4000 MWh/a, generate 1145 MWh/a of RES and reduce around 1496 tCO(2)/a of CO2 emissions, corresponding to specific values of 37.6 kWh/m(2).a and 11.9 kg-CO2/m(2).a for final energy saving and CO2 emission reductions, respectively. KPI-based monitoring and evaluation of the implemented solutions provides qualitative and quantitative insight, experience and lessons learned to optimize the process of implementation and deployment of integrated solutions for holistic building refurbishment, and thus contribute to advancing sustainable urban transformation at the district level for both LHCs and FCs.

AB At present, buildings in arid and hot regions are facing severe challenges of indoor comfort improvement and carbon emission reduction, especially in rural areas. Multi-objective optimization could be an effective tool for tackling the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a life-cycle optimization framework considering thermal comfort, which is beneficial to promoting residents' motivation for low-carbon retrofit in arid climate regions. First, in response to the above problems, three objective functions are specified in the framework, which are global warming potential (GWP), life cycle cost (LCC), and thermal discomfort hours (TDH). To improve the optimization efficiency, this research uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) combined with NSGA-II to construct a high-precision prediction model (meta-model for optimization) based on the energy consumption simulation database formed by the orthogonal multi-dimensional design parameters. The accuracy index of the modified model is R-2 > 0.99, cv(RMSE) <= 1%, and NMBE <= 0.2%, which gets rid of the dilemma of low prediction accuracy of traditional machine learning models. In the scheme comparison and selection stage, the TOPSIS based on two empowerment methods is applied to meet different design tendencies, where the entropy-based method can avoid the interference of subjective preference and significantly improve the objectivity and scientific nature of decision analysis. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the variables, which supports guidance for practitioners to carry out the low-carbon design. Finally, the multi-objective optimization analysis for a farmhouse in Turpan is taken as a case study to evaluate the performance of the framework. The results show that the framework could significantly improve the building performance, with 60.8%, 52.5%, and 14.2% reduction in GWP, LCC, and TDH, respectively.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions, mainly CO2, lead to global climate change, and the resulting ecological environment problems bring severe challenges to human survival and development. As the world's largest developing country and carbon emitter, China is facing the dual pressure of socio-economic development and carbon emission reduction. In order to cope with global climate change and achieve the goal of carbon neutrality and carbon peak as soon as possible, China needs to accelerate the optimization of energy structure, gradually increase the proportion of renewable energy utilization, and accelerate the solution of the bottleneck problem of renewable energy storage. As an energy basin, the Yellow River basin is a key demonstration area to promote energy system reform in China. There are a large number of abandoned mines in the Yellow River basin, which provide a new idea to build pumped storage power stations using abandoned mines (PSPSuM) for renewable energy storage. From the perspective of multidisciplinary integration, this study deeply discusses the relevant evaluation principles and technical key points of constructing PSPSuM in the region, and preliminarily carries out the feasibility assessment. The results show that 91 PSPSuM can be built in the Yellow River basin, with a total installed capacity of 15,830 MW, comprehensively considering the aspects of spatial size, spatial structure and space stability.

DE Carbon peaking; carbon neutrality; the building sector
AB Achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the building sector is an important component of China's "dual carbon" goals. In recent years. the country's direct carbon emissions in the building sector have hit a plateau while the total emissions still grow rapidly. Besides, the building materials for construction and refrigerants leaked during buildings' operation also result in greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve the targets set for future low-carbon development, the building sector should feature "sufficient demand, decarbonized structure and flexible load." According to the analysis of the emission reduction approaches adopted by different sectors, China's building sector should make a ceaseless effort to promote building energy conservation, improve electrification, and load flexibility, reform the energy system in rural areas, optimize the heating structure in northern China's urban areas, as well as reduce the emissions during construction and the non-CO2 gas emissions. In the 14th Five-Year period, it is suggested to clarify the total energy consumption and carbon emission targets, adjust the energy structure more vigorously, and draw up more measures to reduce the emissions related to construction and refrigerant leakage.

AB As housing represents about 60% of cities land use and cities are responsible for 39% of global carbon emissions, this work investigates the emergence of a new generation of Egyptian cities having urban identity and architectural character revealed through climate responsive urban neighbourhood planning adjunct to its housing design in arid regions, while promoting heritage resembled qualities and eco materials. The methodology of planning and designing such cities' neighbourhoods, by connecting Urban-Building-Materials-Renewables (UBMR), has been manifested so that it can be disseminated for arid regions. A comparison between conventionally designed back to back parcel division planning that formulate dot patterns, with the courtyarded clustered free planning and energy plus designed neighborhood in Cairo, Egypt took place. A multi objective workflow assessment method was applied using ENVI-met V4.0 for urban microcimate simulations, Radiance for annual cumulative radiation and Energy-plus for urban energy use intensity to quantify different environmental sustainability measures and persuade decision-makers of the suggested design paradigm shift. Further, life cycle cost (LCC) analysis took place to correlate and quantify assessment measures of applied environmental and socioeconomic sustainability systems, such as the Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV), low-cost Stabilized Compressed Earth Blocks (SCEB) construction that support envelope passive design, affordability, and housing diversity. Combined UBMR solutions showed improved comfortable outdoor areas by 47.8% during extreme summer afternoon, increased annual solar energy generation potential by 13.87% and the energy-efficient envelope reduced cooling energy consumption by 28.9% while reducing cost of construction by 95.5%. As of socioeconomic sustainability, all measures showed an evidence of preferability for the court-yarded clustered urban form attributed to the low-cost construction that offered more affordability over 50 and 100 years with green industrial and construction mechanism that empowered job opportunities, more housing designs' diversity that can be generated per each cluster, and more walkable streets according to pedestrian comfort maps.
   Modeling the 3D recipe of environment consciousness while retrieving the socio-economic flavor values of ancestors' free planning renewed the architectural character and urban identity picture, as if getting back to heritage free planning that generates courtyarded urban clusters could evolve a future class climate responsive Neo-Arid city.

AB Many areas in the world with chronic and intermittent water shortages rely on informal water systems for much of their daily water needs with water from tanker trucks, purchased bottled water, rainwater cisterns, or pumped well water. These alternative sources all require varying amounts of energy. Water-energy nexus studies have not yet considered environmental impacts of informal water sources, specifically from an energy intensity and carbon emissions perspective. This study compares energy use and carbon emissions per cubic meter and per capita for both formal and informal water sources for a neighborhood in Beirut Lebanon. Energy use and carbon emissions are calculated for three delivery stages per source including pumping, treatment and distribution. The results show that informal sources have the highest energy use and carbon emissions. From the total water delivered to households, they account for 83% of energy use and 72% of carbon emissions per capita, even though they only provide 23% of total delivered volume per capita. Bottled water and distribution of water by tanker trucks have the highest energy intensity values per cubic meter of all water sources. Moreover, internal building water pumping, which is not typically accounted for, takes up to 14% of total energy use and 23% of total carbon emissions per capita compared to other water sources. To address model uncertainty, we conduct a sensitivity analysis, showing that the base model presented reasonably stable results and identifying the most sensitive parameters for further research. While informal sources help communities overcome water shortages they result with negative impacts. Strategies are proposed to improve the environmental performance of the Lebanese electrical grid, reduce water losses, replace inefficient truck engines and incentivize household to invest in low carbon technologies.

AB As the largest ecological background system and basic economic unit in China, counties are of great significance to China's carbon emission reduction targets. This article conducts theoretical model construction and empirical test research from a contraction perspective, using population and built-up area change as variables and combining indicators of county scale structure in an attempt to find key scale structure elements and representative indicators that affect the carbon emission intensity of counties. By using data from 140 counties in Northeast China during the period of 2015-2020, an empirical study was conducted on population shrinkage clustering, county size structure, and carbon emission intensity. The results show that: (1) population shrinkage significantly increases the carbon intensity of counties, but the contribution of population shrinkage to carbon intensity is scale-heterogeneous, the contribution effect decreases with population size, and the effect on large counties is minimal; (2) population size and industrial structure are the main factors influencing carbon intensity in counties, both have a negative linear elasticity relationship, and GDP per capita is not included in the overall model and is only significant in large counties; (3) the relationship between total construction land and carbon intensity is an inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve, with a critical value of 30 km(2), and the total construction land in most counties is below or close to the critical value.

AB Modelling energy retrofit adoption in domestic urban building stocks is vital for policymakers aiming to reduce emissions. The use of surrogate models to evaluate building performance combined with optimization procedures can optimize small building stocks but are insufficient at the urban scale. Recent methods train neural networks using samples of near-optimal solutions further decreasing the computational cost of optimization. However, these models do not make definitive predictions of decision makers with given environmental preferences. To rectify this, we extend the method by assigning a carbon valuation to households to derive their optimal retrofit solutions. By including the carbon valuation when training the predictive model, we can analyze the impact of households' changing attitudes to emissions. To demonstrate this method we construct an agent-based model of Nottingham, finding that simulated government campaigns to boost environmentalism improve both the number of retrofits performed and the mean emissions reduction of each installation.

AB Decarbonisation and climate change targets require multiscale sociotechnical energy transitions that include significant changes to housing stock. In the UK, the development of Active Buildings, which directly seek to be efficient energy producers, have zero carbon emissions and provide grid flexibility, has the potential to make a significant contribution to meeting these targets. Active Homes as a particular type of Active Building represent a potentially transformational innovation by altering how energy is produced, distributed and consumed, in addition to how homes are designed, constructed and then lived in. In this paper we draw on insights from qualitative interviews with stakeholders involved in the development of different Active Homes to consider motivations for development, and their views on how residents will reside in and interact with the homes. We highlight a potential conflict between a desire to prioritise the needs of residents with a belief amongst some that to do so, user engagement with technology should be minimised. This has implications for design decisions, which in turn influence how residents experience and live within the homes. In illuminating these narratives, we indicate the necessity of ongoing engagement with residents to understand how Active Homes - with particular emphasis on the operation and control of technologies - are experienced, in order to inform the successful rollout of current and future developments.

AB The use of heat pumps in buildings is one of the best and often the only option for the decarbonization of the building stock. District heating seems a promising solution in urban areas and in existing buildings when the use of heat pumps is restricted and also technically and economically challenging (source exploitation, space restrictions, sound emissions, etc.). Heat pumps can be integrated in various ways in buildings and district heating systems: large central high-temperature heat pumps in district heating, medium-size heat pumps block- or building-wise or small heat pumps decentral apartment-wise. The best option depends on the individual district heating CO2 emissions and the electricity mix as well as on the perspective of the building owner versus that one of the district heating system and its future development. Austrian examples of district heating systems and different variants of integrating heat pumps are investigated in a comprehensive way by means of an energetic and environmental simulation-based analysis. This assessment includes a detailed investigation of the capabilities of the booster heat pump to increase the PV own-consumption and is also expanded to include various scenarios for the development of the electricity mix and the decarbonisation of district heating.

AB District heating has an important role in the shift to carbon-neutral energy systems through enabling the use of heat sources that would otherwise be wasted to cover buildings' heating demands. The availability of many renewable and surplus heat sources is however in opposite phase with the heating demand, creating a demand for seasonal thermal energy storage. This study performs a techno-economic assessment of the heat supply system of a residential area in Norway, where seasonal storage storing excess heat from a waste incineration plant is being planned. A heat supply solution combining seasonal storage and low-temperature district heating was compared with two more conventional alternatives: high-temperature district heating and direct electric heating.
   The study shows that the seasonal storage is not cost optimal under the conditions assumed, in particular regarding the electricity market; however, the total costs were only 3% higher compared to electric heating. Seasonal storage additionally allows to reduce the use of peak heating units in the district heating system in the winter, thus reducing the costs and emissions related to heat production, and district heating alone has a significant impact in alleviating the pressure on the power grid. The peak power demand was reduced by 28% when investing to low- or high-temperature district heating, and seasonal storage was shown to enable up to 31% reduction in the peak heating demand. Moreover, it was shown that higher electricity prices in the winter and reduced grid capacity increase the economic viability of the solution and could make it competitive. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Energy consumption is steadily increasing with the ever-growing population, leading to a rise in global warming. Building energy consumption is one of the major sources of global warming, which can be controlled with renewable energy installations. This paper deals with an advanced evacuated hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal collector (PVT) for simultaneous production of electricity and domestic hot water (DHW) with lower carbon emissions. Most PVT projects focus on increasing electricity production by cooling the photovoltaic (PV). However, in this research, increasing thermal efficiency is investigated through vacuum glass tube encapsulation. The required area for conventional unglazed PVT systems varies between 1.6-2 times of solar thermal collectors for similar thermal output. In the case of encapsulation, the required area can decrease by minimizing convective losses from the system. Surprisingly, the electrical efficiency was not decreased by encapsulating the PVT system. The performance of evacuated PVT is compared to glazed and unglazed PVTs, and the result shows a 40% increase in thermal performance with the proposed system. All three systems are simulated in ANSYS 18.1 (Canonsburg, PA, USA) at different mass flow rates and solar irradiance.

AB In developed countries, a large part of the building stock in 2050 will consist of currently existing buildings. Consequently, in order to achieve the objectives in terms of energy efficiency in the building sector we must consider not only new infrastructures but also the old ones. A reduction in energy consumption for climate control of between 50 and 90% can be achieved by rehabilitation and the implementation of different energy efficiency measures. Currently, these measures to reduce energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions can be modelled using computer tools. However, high precision and detail of thermal behaviour models through simulations can mean a great computational cost for companies, which results in a blockage of servers and workers. In this paper, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is presented as an innovative methodology for the simplification of models for calculation of the energy savings associated with thermal comfort improvement in buildings. A single-family house model, located in three different climates, is presented as a case study in order to validate the proposed methodology. Different scenarios were simulated, addressing heating and cooling temperature set points and external wall insulation represented by the transmittance (U-value). Results obtained from energy simulation using Design Builder were contrasted against those estimated from the simplified model extracted from the RSM analysis. The results revealed a deviation lower than 3% when comparing both methods. Therefore, the simplified mathematical prediction models are demonstrated to be suitable for the study of the energy performance of buildings, saving computational time, costs and associated human resources.

AB The demand for heating in cold regions drives up carbon emissions every year. In order to achieve China's carbon neutrality target by 2060, CO2 emissions in the cold regions must be reduced. In this paper, using Design Builder software, a simulation model of residential buildings in severe cold regions was created, and the most appropriate parameter design scheme for carbon emission reduction of residential buildings in severe cold regions was derived by simulating the experimental data of the original parameter design scheme and the changed parameter design scheme, as well as the calculation of carbon dioxide emission reduction rate. In order to make the comparison of the results easier, no change was made in the selection of the changed scheme for the external insulation material, foamed polystyrene panels. The results show that the most suitable parameter scheme for houses in severe cold regions is 85 mm thick foamed polystyrene panels for exterior walls, 200 mm thick foamed polystyrene panels for roofs, and exterior windows should use semi-tempered plastic steel frame and triple glass 6 mm glass + vacuum + 6 mm low-e glass + 12 mm air + 6 mm glass composed of windows. This technique saves 30.32% of energy as compared to the original parameter design approach. The efficiency of energy conservation is 33.03%. The emission reduction effect is significant. The best parametric design plan has a static payback period of 5 years. The best parametric design plan has a discounted payback period of 7 and a net present value of USD 65,413.39. This scheme can provide a great economic return while also increasing the performance of the building.

AB As the main construction type in urban centers, urban complex has become the focus of energy-saving and emission-reducing studies facing the severe challenges of energy crisis and environmental problems. However, the current energy-saving design is usually carried out after the layout design of buildings, which limits the energy-saving effect. This study supposes to improve the integrated energy performance of urban complex before the architectural design. Based on the operating characteristics of distributed energy resource system, we study the reasonable building area ratios of urban complex in different cli-mate zones in China by the energy simulation, scenario analysis and multi-criteria assessment methods. Primary energy consumption saving rate, carbon dioxide emission reduction rate and operating cost sav -ing rate are selected to assess the integrated energy performance of urban complex. The results indicate that (1) building area ratios have an appreciable impact on the integrated energy benefits of urban com-plex, while the climatic conditions have less impact on the optimization of its building area ratio scheme; (2) area ratio scheme with more "residence" and balanced ratio of other basic functions show the optimal integrated energy benefits of the urban complex with DER system; (3) optimal building area ratio scheme of urban complexes in different types and different climate conditions achieve an integrated saving rate of 22.2%-46.5%. The main findings of this study could be a useful quantitative reference for the pre-planning of urban complex, which also contribute to the energy conservation and pollution reduction of urban area in the future.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Construction stakeholders aim at limiting the impact of the construction sector on the natural environment to assure sustainability. The construction industry forms a significant portion of the Egyptian GDP and employs millions of labor force and consumes most of the country's energy and its primary resources. Egypt faces dual pressure of maintaining economic growth and largely reducing carbon emissions. This study aims at exploring the effect of finance-growth-energy nexus on carbon emissions for Egypt over the 1990-2050 period. By employing the system dynamics approach, the study tries to capture the impact of some investment policies on the consumption of energy, financial development and economic growth in addition to linking them with the carbon emissions of Egypt in a simulation model using Vensim (R) PLE software. The model provides the policy makers with a simulating tool supporting their decisions. The findings reveal that both construction technology, represented in construction materials and construction machinery, and labor education are main keys of true sustainable development. Several policies are examined to study system behavior and revealed that it is not enough to capture the technology in order to achieve development, and suitable education and training courses should be provided to deliver labor force that can use and improve such technologies. The proposed methodology aids construction in Egypt which is considered a strong indicator of the country's economic strength. The construction industry forms a significant portion of the Egyptian GDP and employs millions of labor force and consumes most of the country's energy and its primary resources. To remain vital, the construction industry is demanding better, safer, energy-efficient and more affordable construction materials and technology.

AB Multiple market failures have historically delivered housing that is environmentally and economically sub-optimal. Minimum energy standards are a popular policy tool for lowering energy use and anthropogenic carbon emissions in the built environment, but evidence shows they fail to drive performance beyond that minimum. Mandating the disclosure of energy performance on sale or lease of property has been introduced in some jurisdictions to transform the building stock and encourage energy and carbon saving improvements. These policy instruments address different market failures and have the potential to act as complementary regulation, but to date there has been little evidence that the combination may deliver greater benefits than each individual policy measure. The analysis of 342,674 housing energy assessments in Australia from May 2016-June 2021 highlights the impact of complementary vs. single policy instruments. We find that the building regulatory process alone delivers certainty regarding minimum performance, but when matched with disclosure regulation, the market is pulled slightly toward higher performance outcomes than for where building regulations alone are used. While only a small improvement in performance, the data supports the power of complementary regulation for long-life housing assets, similar to the benefits found for shorter-life assets such as household appliances; in essence creating both a carrot and a stick for consumers and the wider market. The data from Australia presented in this paper suggests that the use of complementary regulation may deliver improved environmental and economic outcomes and could help jurisdictions governing a transition to more sustainable housing as part of the wider transition to sustainable cities.

AB For mitigating climate change and respect targets, humanity must decrease emissions as soon as possible: the later is the action, the harsher will be the trajectory of the mitigating pathway. Structural actions need time to become operational. Therefore, individual actions shall also enter into play, focusing on what has a high impact and whose change is at hand: food-related emissions build up 30% of total anthropogenic impacts and eating is an everyday activity. In this study, regional culturally acceptable low-carbon diets are proposed for China, Europe and US. They are developed considering the requirements of energy and nutrients supply, they respect regionality of food consumption - e.g., they include only foods that are diffused in the area - and they are aimed to limit the individual effort to be adopted - e.g., they include all the food categories, meat included. They are low-carbon since food items are selected on the basis of their lifecycle carbon footprint (CF). Eventually, the regionality constraints are relaxed to develop a World's low-carbon diet. For every area, we found a diet that halves the food-related CF. Instead, our World's low-carbon diet reduces the average food-related CF by 75%. Therefore, the overall individual CF would be reduced by a fifth in case of its adoption.

AB Adaptation to climate change in cities is essential, and vertical greenery systems (VGSs) are used as a means of restoring the urban areas' ecological integrity. This paper presents the classification, typology, and benefits of the VGS for the energy performance of buildings. To analyse its energy and environmental impacts, the use of VGS was simulated on the facades of residential buildings in the urban area of the City of Banja Luka. The results showed that VGS reduced the temperature of the wall and air in and around the buildings, as well as the emission of CO2 in the air.

AB Controlling the scale of civil buildings is of great significance for energy saving and emission reduction in the construction field. This paper analyzes and extracts the key index parameters for the calculation of various civil building areas, establishes a detailed calculation model of the total civil building area, and constructs three different scenarios to predict various civil building areas in China from 2020 to 2060. Under the three scenarios, the total amount of civil buildings in China will reach a peak of 93.5, 84.6, and 76.3 billion m(2) in 2040, 2035, and 2035, respectively. Under the constraints of energy consumption and carbon emission, this paper suggests that civil buildings develop according to the medium control scenario. In 2035, the urban per capita residential area will reach a peak of 42 m(2), the urban residential area will reach 43 billion m(2), the rural per capita residential area will reach the peak of 55 m(2), the rural residential area will reach 20.6 billion m(2), and the public building area will reach 21 billion m(2). By 2060, the total area of civil buildings will drop to 76.5 billion m(2), including 37.1 billion m(2) of urban residential buildings, 18.5 billion m(2) of rural residential buildings, and 20.9 billion m(2) of public buildings.

AB Nature-based conservation management (NBCMs) estates are seen as natural solutions to climate change and hence immune to harmful greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, NBCMs, in their daily operations to protect and conserve biodiversity, may result in GHG emissions. These may come as a significant carbon burden. This is the first study based on a literature review to look at the carbon footprint of an entire conservation estate operation and management. South African National Parks (SANParks) aimed to contribute to national targets by reducing their fossil-fuel-generated energy consumption by 2% per year until achieving carbon neutrality. The objectives of this paper were (1) to quantify the SANParks C emissions profile at the organization and individual park level and develop recommendations to sustainably reduce carbon emissions and (2) to suggest alternative scenarios that SANParks could follow to achieve zero energy emissions. The study presented an audit analysis of the emission sources linked to SANParks' daily activities over a five-year period (2015-2019) using the GHGs protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard methodology. Over the reference period, SANParks emitted an average of 73,732 t of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO(2)e) per year. Most emissions came from electricity usage, 40,681 tCO(2)e (55%), followed by fuel usage for stationary combustion at 26,088 tCO(2)e (35%), and both account for 90% of SANParks' total emissions. Results have shown the variation amongst individual parks in GHG emission and intensity ratio among the different parks. Total SANParks emission showed a significant relationship with Scope 2, followed by number of employees, building size, Scope 3, and Scope 1, in order. This work recommends how SANParks estate may reduce their carbon emissions at a national and individual level. SANParks achieved 1% year-on-year energy emissions reduction through its renewable base; however, an ambitious target of 8% would be appropriate for a 1.5 degrees C future based on the energy scenario planning.

AB The construction sector is one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and consumers of energy, making it one of the most relevant sectors when planning reduction strategies and policies. The use of timber in the built environment has been identified as a key strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of the construction sector. In this paper, we use the concept of policy gap analysis to identified underlying challenges in the implementation of timber construction on three Nordic countries, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. We carried out a series of semi-structured interviews with experts from the countries of study. The interviews came from industry, government, and construction companies. The use of the gap analysis approach was useful not only to identify areas that are being targeted but also those areas that were not covered by any programme at the time of study. The results showed that the studied programmes have a large level of coverage and congruence with the identified challenges. Moreover, they also showed that challenges related to fire safety regulations and insurance policies for timber buildings still need to be addressed, whereas the challenges of high price variability and lack of promotion are being addressed by multiple programmes. With this work, we have seen how timber construction is gaining momentum and how the challenges have been addressed systematically.

AB Since existing residential buildings are a significant global contributor to energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, any serious effort to reduce the actual energy and carbon emissions of the building sector should explicitly address the carbon mitigation challenges and opportunities in the building stock. This research investigates environmentally and economically sustainable retrofit methods to reduce the carbon footprint of existing residential buildings in the City of Greater Dandenong as a case study in Metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. By categorizing energy use into various building age brackets and dwelling types that align with changes in energy regulations, we identified various retrofit prototypes to achieve a targeted 6.5-star and 8-star energy efficiency rating (out of a maximum 10-star rating system). The corresponding operational energy savings through different retrofit options are examined while also considering the quantity of materials required for each option, along with their embodied energy and GHG emissions, thus allowing a more comprehensive lifecycle carbon analysis and exploration of their financial and environmental payback times. Results show that when buildings are upgraded with a combination of insulation and double-glazed windows, the environmental benefits rise faster than the financial benefits over a dwelling's lifecycle. The size or percentage of a particular dwelling type within the building stock and the remaining lifecycle period are found to be the most important factors influencing the payback periods. Retrofitting the older single detached dwellings shows the greatest potential for lifecycle energy and carbon savings in the case suburb. These findings provide households, industry and governments some guidance on how to contribute most effectively to reduce the carbon footprint of the residential building sector.

AB Higher education institutions (HEIs) consume significant energy and water and contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. HEIs are under pressure internally and externally to improve their overall performance on reducing GHG emissions within their boundaries. It is necessary to identify critical areas of high GHG emissions within a campus to help find solutions to improve the overall sustainability performance of the campus. An integrated probabilistic-fuzzy framework is developed to help universities address the uncertainty associated with the reporting of water, energy, and carbon (WEC) flows within a campus. The probabilistic assessment using Monte Carlo Simulations effectively addressed the aleatory uncertainties, due to the randomness in the variations of the recorded WEC usages, while the fuzzy synthetic evaluation addressed the epistemic uncertainties, due to vagueness in the linguistic variables associated with WEC benchmarks. The developed framework is applied to operational, academic, and residential buildings at the University of British Columbia (Okanagan Campus). Three scenarios are analyzed, allocating the partial preference to water, or energy, or carbon. Furthermore, nine temporal seasons are generated to assess the variability, due to occupancy and climate changes. Finally, the aggregation is completed for the assessed buildings. The study reveals that climatic and type of buildings significantly affect the overall performance of a university. This study will help the sustainability centers and divisions in HEIs assess the spatiotemporal variability of WEC flows and effectively address the uncertainties to cover a wide range of human judgment.

AB This study investigates the factors influencing the carbon emission of Chinese residents in urban and rural areas. Drawing on the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI), the results of this study identify the increasing demand for energy consumption from residential buildings and the strengthening of the volume effect as the primary causes for the surging carbon emission by residents. Rural areas feature a larger cumulative contribution to carbon emission due to energy demand from housing and transportation and a higher contribution to the volume effect of energy consumption. In contrast, urbanization, a key driver for residents' energy consumption, shows a year-by-year decline.

AB Current climate change threats and increasing CO2 emissions, especially from the building stock, represent a context where action is required. It is necessary to provide efficient manners to manage energy demand in buildings and contribute to a decarbonised future. By combining new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, Internet of things, blockchain, and the exploitation of big data towards solving real life problems, the way could be paved towards smart and energy-aware buildings. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a critical review and an in-detail definition of the big data value chain for the built environment in Europe, covering multiple needs and perspectives: "policy", "technology" and "business", in order to explore the main challenges and opportunities in this area.

AB In our built environment, flat glass is an indispensable material. Its production requires the mining of raw materials and the use of fossil fuels and results in the emission of pollutants including CO2. In Western European countries, these emissions have been the target of a series of energy efficiency measures and emission reduction policies since 1945. Beginning with that year, this article studies the material history of the flat glass industry in Belgium, France and the EU and analyses the evolution of the flows of materials, energy and CO2 related to the manufacturing process. Based on a retrospective material and energy flow analysis (MEFA), the objective is to assess the environmental footprint of the architectural flat glass sector and to provide an understanding of the socioecological patterns that have shaped its metabolism.
   Based on an extensive data collection, this paper is the first publication of long-term time series on the manufacturing of architectural glass. The findings reveal two major concerns: on the one hand, energy efficiency measures have weakened ever since the 1990s, despite the tightening of the European environmental policies; on the other hand, the demand for architectural glass in the EU remains particularly high, resulting in a production rate that uses considerable energy and exploits a large amount of raw materials. The relative decoupling of the energy and CO2 intensities seems to have reached a threshold and has not resulted in an absolute decoupling of environmental burdens from industrial growth. We discuss measures and research needs to support a decarbonisation of the flat glass sector.

AB Vietnam has been one of the nations strongly affected by climate change; hence, finding and promoting solutions in order to adapt and proactively respond to climate change have played an extremely significant role. A strategy of developing a low-carbon economy with eco-friendly production and consumption models, limiting the use of fossil fuels, and rising clean as well as renewable energy have been built with the aim to reduce total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by roughly 8% by the year 2030 compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario under the Paris Agreement 2015, in particular, focusing on producing a plan to drop considerably methane (CH4) emission and recover energy from landfill sites as the waste sector has been the third-highest GHG contributor in Vietnam. This study concentrates on forecasting and evaluating CH4, CO, H2S, and CH3SH emissions for a case study in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam: in specific, two dumping sites of Thanh Hoa and Kien Tuong according to four different scenarios so that the landfill gas (LFG) emissions are controlled under the local authority orientation of installing a gas collection system and treating captured gases by an LFG flaring approach from 2021 to 2030. Quantification of the generated LFG is carried out using a mathematical modeling method having validation with field measured data, which is a WebGIS software named EnLandFill with integrated mathematical models, environmental information, and databases allowing analysis of the main influence of two L-0 and k factors on LFG emission levels. On the one hand, based on the development planning of Long An province from 2021 to 2030, the municipal solid waste (MSW) volume is estimated at around 3.5 million tonnes and the potential waste generation index is predicted between 0.7 and 1.2 kg person(-1) day(-1). A large amount of CH4 emissions are considered to be a remarkable contributor to GHG emissions. It can be seen that there are about 32.1-253.6 million m(3) CH4 (or equivalent to 512-589 thousand tCO(2)-eq) and 1.0-5.1 million m(3) CH4 (or equivalent to 16-81 thousand tCO2-eq) created at Thanh Hoa and Kien Tuong dumping sites, respectively, under the established scenarios in the 2021-2030 period. On the other hand, the proposal of scenario 4 is found to be the optimal solution for GHG emission control and decline from this study area in the next years. Furthermore, the obtained study outcomes are considered as a basis for planning and managing the issues of MSW in Long An province until 2050 towards a circular economy.

AB This study aims to optimize the calorific value with different fuel properties derived from two peat reserved areas. A total of 60 peat samples were evaluated using proximate analysis (moisture content, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash content) of two separate studied areas. A quadratic polynomial of response surface methodology was applied to the entire set of subsequently studied results. Several analytical equations were used in linear and nonlinear terms to estimate the higher calorific value. Peat samples at Terokhada Upazila show a higher calorific value of 7.050 kcal kg(-1), whereas the calorific value of peat sample at Bil Baghia in Madaripur found 5.800 kcal kg(-1). The optimal calorific value of peat in both studied areas is 7.05-11.05 kcal kg(-1) in Terokhada Upazila and 3.156-7.187 kcal kg(-1) in Bil Baghia, Madaripur, respectively. Terokhada Upazila and Bil Baghia, Madaripur, exhibit analytical values of squares regression of (0.0068-0.1245) and (0.003-0.091), respectively. In addition, the standard deviations are found to be between 1.049 and 4.505 kcal kg(-1) for Terokhada Upazila peat and between 0.1741 and 2.741 kcal kg1 for Bil Baghia, Madaripur peat, respectively. The RSM quadratic polynomial represents the optimization, and the coded equations are built for two research areas to precisely estimate the highest calorific value. These peats could be helpful to fuel sources if gasified or co-burned with other fuel resources to generate energy. Peat with a higher calorific value can be used as an energy source in the Bangladesh energy sector and globally.

AB The building sector is responsible for 43% of France's final energy consumption and is strongly associated with a high environmental impact due to its high consumption of energy and natural resources. These impacts are significant in isolated islands. Due to its geographical isolation and an area of 2512 km(2), Reunion Island has a heavily carbon-based economy with a high import rate of raw materials for the building sector. This study aimed to investigate the effect of electricity mix decarbonization on residential house environmental impact. The methodology consists of three parts: (i) evaluating environmental impacts of Single-Family Houses (SFH) using life cyce assessment(LCA), (ii) defining SFH typologies using the K-means clustering algorithm, and (iii) implementing energy scenario in LCA of SFH to assess decarbonization effect. The environmental results were particularly sensitive in the operational phase, with a decrease of 83% between 2020 to 2040 of the global warming potential (GWP). The structural phase highlights the weight of imports in the building sector, as a decrease of only 1% is observed. This study clearly shows the necessary energy transition for Reunion Island. In the structural phase, the study recommends that stakeholders reduce imports and increase the share of recovered materials to achieve a substantial reduction in impacts.

AB When developing a sustainability plan in a complex and heavily urbanized territory, one of the most relevant options available is installing rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panels. Thus, it is essential to determine the amount of available surface and the potential impact of such installations on the energy and emission budget of the area. Instead of processing remotely sensed imagery, which is a long process and does not allow considering the buildings' ownership, this study develops an approach based on a cluster analysis of the urban/morphological characteristics of the municipalities. Once a clear group diversification is obtained, the roof surface of the center of gravity of each cluster is extrapolated to all similar settlements. This, together with the information of local solar irradiation, allowed us to compute each cluster's potential solar energy production and its capability to respond to the local energy demand, a key parameter to decide about the possibility of a local smart electricity network. Finally, the emissions avoided thanks to solar PV development are computed in terms of carbon dioxide and other relevant pollutants. This approach is applied to the residential rooftop of Lombardy, a Northern Italy region with a wide variety of urban morphologies and landscapes. The potential production of rooftop PV exceeds the estimated electricity consumption of residential buildings and would allow sparing almost 4 M ton of CO2 equivalent or 5% of the overall regional emissions.

AB The new paradigm of Net Zero Energy buildings is a challenge for architects and engineers, especially in buildings with large glazing areas. Water Flow Glazing (WFG) is a dynamic facade technology shown to reduce heating and cooling loads for buildings significantly. Photovoltaic panels placed on building roofs can generate enough electricity from solar energy without generating greenhouse gases in operation or taking up other building footprints. This paper investigates the techno-economic viability of a grid-connected solar photovoltaic system combined with water flow glazing. An accurate assessment of the economic and energetic feasibility is carried out through simulation software and on-site tests on an actual prototype. The assessment also includes the analysis of global warming potential reduction. A prototype with WFG envelope has been tested. The WFG prototype actual data reported primary energy savings of 62% and 60% CO2 equivalent emission reduction when comparing WFG to a reference triple glazing. Finally, an economic report of the Photovoltaic array showed the Yield Factor and the Levelized Cost of Energy of the system. Savings over the operating lifetime can compensate for the high initial investment that these two technologies require.

AB Countries and cities alike have set carbon neutrality goals for the near future. Urban areas are experiencing an increased demand for new housing developments, and buildings are responsible for one third of all greenhouse gas emissions. The relative share of construction emissions is increasing as energy production is de-carbonizing. Wooden structures have showcased potential in substantially decreasing these emissions. However, for the construction industry to utilize environmentally friendly products, the cost efficiency needs to be determined. Prior research does not present conclusive results regarding the construction costs or value of wooden buildings. This study aims to determine the economic feasibility of wood-based structures in housing.We approach this by estimating the effect of wood on Finnish dwelling prices through hedonic regression analyses. Dwelling prices are analysed with transaction data from the Helsinki metropolitan area. It is provided by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies. The data represents occurred transactions between 1999 and 2018. The study discovers that a wooden structure has a positive price effect in the Helsinki metropolitan region suggesting an economically feasible opportunity to create low carbon urban housing. In the city of Helsinki, the effect is statistically significant (+8.85%) whereas no significance is found in either Espoo or Vantaa. The results suggest that in Helsinki, a direct financial benefit exists for both the city and private developers. For other cities, the study encourages the increase of consumption of wood due to its environmental properties. The study implies that wooden construction is an economically feasible solution in mitigating climate change. As this may provoke an increased demand for wood in construction, further research should be conducted to analyse its effects on the economy and the environment.

AB Today, low carbon policies are more important in developing countries such as Iran with an oil-based economy. The present study addresses Semnan as a major Iranian city and attempts to examine carbon emissions from residential buildings, industrial plants and motor vehicles with new methodology to analyse the interaction of urban design and carbon emissions.
   First, carbon emission sources were examined; then, the summarised models and methods based on background researches have been divided into two general categories of carbon emission calculation and simulation to be used in softwares based on the level of accuracy and nature of their sources.
   The results show that the increased penetration of carbon emissions into residential areas can be reduced by designs that conform to climate changes (such as block arrangements and orientations) to avoid the pollutant to enter and to reduce the need for energy consumption.

AB Spain has a high level of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in detached houses, being the lack of an adequate insulation level and efficient energy systems the main causes. The Spanish Government has been performing modifications on its Building Technical Code (BTC) to address this issue, following European Directives. An assessment of the development of the Spanish BTC from its first 2006 version has been conducted in this work. A standard Spanish detached house was placed in the different Spanish climatic zones, designed with the minimum requirements of the 2006 and 2013 BTCs, and was then analyzed using the software Cerma. The results show that energy demand is reduced and the energy rating is improved with the stricter requirements introduced in the 2013 BTC. Although energy demand and CO2 emissions vary significantly among the 13 different climatic zones studied, the BTC modifications allow to reach a minimum energy rating independently of the climatic zone where the house is located. Opaque enclosures and internal loads were found to be the main contributors to building-related emissions. Additionally, possible actions to improve energy rating in detached houses are evaluated, finding that a moderate insulation thickness increase and the installation of heat pumps allow to reach the highest energy rating, being the improvement more apparent in northern and central regions. The results of this work may be extrapolated to other countries with similar climatic conditions to the studied zones, providing guidelines to fulfill energy saving regulations, evaluate emission sources and improve building energy efficiency.

AB Space cooling accounts for high percentage of energy consumption in modern city building. To improve energy utilizing efficient of space cooling, a new system based on solar partial-coupling ejection-compression refrigeration cycle is studied. Builds are assumed to be located at modern city of Shanghai, with area of 100 m(2) for each floor. With a model combining cooling system, building, and weather information, comparative analysis is carried out hourly, using new perspective of total primary energy, during the whole cooling season. For the building with a common height of six-storey in modern city, partial-coupling ejection-compression refrigeration cycle reveals obvious superiority in electric coefficient of performance, solar factor, thermal coefficient of performance, total primary energy, with best value of 6.2, 1, 3.6, and 14 kW, respectively, which helps to reduce carbon dioxide emission. The remarkable difference in auxiliary heat between partial-coupling ejection compression refrigeration cycle and traditional ejection-compression refrigeration cycle results in the great primary energy saving of partial-coupling cycle, which reveals significant superiority and good suitability of partial-coupling cycle used in multi-stroey buildings in modern city.

AB Heat demand of buildings and related CO2 emissions caused by energy supply contribute to global climate change. Spatial data-based heat planning enables municipalities to reorganize local heating sectors towards efficient use of regional renewable energy resources. Here, annual heat demand of residential buildings is modeled and mapped for a German federal state to provide regional basic data. Using a 3D building stock model and standard values of building-type-specific heat demand from a regional building typology in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based bottom-up approach, a first base reference is modeled. Two spatial data sets with information on the construction period of residential buildings, aggregated on municipality sections and hectare grid cells, are used to show how census-based spatial data sets can enhance the approach. Partial results from all three models are validated against reported regional data on heat demand as well as against gas consumption of a municipality. All three models overestimate reported heat demand on regional levels by 16% to 19%, but underestimate demand by up to 8% on city levels. Using the hectare grid cells data set leads to best prediction accuracy values at municipality section level, showing the benefit of integrating this high detailed spatial data set on building age.

AB The plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC) is a technology built to produce renewable and sustainable electricity in order to meet the increasing global demand. This study demonstrates the potential application of PMFC in swamps dominated by water hyacinth to produce biological energy and plant biomass. In this research, the plant was integrated into a microbial fuel cell that adopts various types of anode materials such as carbon felt, iron and zinc, with a varying distance of 10 and 20 cm between the anode and cathode. Organic compounds emerging from the photosynthesis process were deposited by plant roots, which were then oxidized by bacteria in the mud media. The result showed that the developed PMFC produced a voltage and current density of 244.8 mV and 185.4 mA/m(2), respectively, for 30 days, with a maximum power of 100.2 mW/m(2) in the cells using zinc as anode material with an electrode spacing of 10 cm. Furthermore, the pH value on PMFC with a longer electrode was higher than the shorter distance due to the protons' inability to move from anode to cathode against the force of gravity. In conclusion, PMFC which utilizes water hyacinth has a good performance in converting chemical energy from the substrate into electrical energy, and has the potential to be developed in underdeveloped areas.

AB Buildings are linked to a significant untapped energy saving potential, accounting for 40 % of European Union's (EU) final energy and 36 % of CO2 emissions. Energy efficient building envelopes plays the key role to achieve decarbonization of the EU's building stock by 2050. Active building envelopes are emerging and novel trend offering the paradigm shift in perception of building enclosures. Paper presents study of active solar facade containing phase change material for energy storage. Study seeks for optimisation of solar facade module by introducing dynamic component and variating in the composition of module itself to ensure faster energy harvesting and minimise the heat losses at discharging phase. Comparative tests were carried out in laboratory, in controlled heating and cooling conditions to evaluate impact of dynamic component. The dynamic component has reflective inner coating that focuses solar radiation on the element in heating phase and aerogel insulation filling in the blades that decreases heat loss in the cooling phase. Varying components in the design were used- thickness of aerogel insulation, Fresnel lens and width of concentrating cone diameter. Wide range of phase change material average temperature was observed 24 degrees C in setups with full aerogel filling to 50 degrees C in setup Fresnel lens. Average temperature in phase change material was reached higher in all setups with dynamic component compared to identical setups without dynamic component. Temperature differences were in the range from 1 degrees C in aerogel filled setups till 6 degrees C in setups with Fresnel lens.

AB School buildings, like many buildings around the world, are rapidly aging and becoming increasingly inefficient, leading to unnecessary carbon emissions and high utility bills. School buildings can offer some of the most cost-effective carbon abatement opportunities; however, very few schools focus on quantifiable carbon reduction. This is despite the growing emphasis on school sustainability and there is a notable gap in the literature in this area. This study examined 13 schools that participated in an innovative 2-year Low Carbon Schools Pilot Program (LCSPP) in Perth, Western Australia and explores how schools can effectively reduce their carbon emissions and operational costs associated with their buildings and infrastructure. Utility data from electricity, gas and water from the schools were analysed in conjunction with the initiatives each school implemented to identify the highest impact initiatives. The study showed that schools reduced their carbon emissions on average by 20% on a per student basis and saved an average of 15% in costs. More than 70% of the actions identified by participating schools were low or zero cost. This study demonstrates the abundant opportunities available for schools to reduce their consumption of resources, carbon emissions and utility costs with minimal to no cost outlay.

AB Biogas digester programmes have been rolled out across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade with varying levels of success. In Ethiopia, reported success rates have been low, despite high levels of interaction between non-governmental organisations and various levels of government, plus the establishment of practical eligibility criteria. In Halaba, Ethiopia, we investigated physical and social factors affecting feedstock and water availability using a face-to-face questionnaire-based survey (n = 112) in four kebeles (local administration areas). We found that practices of fuel use and water collection were markedly different between seasons. Fuel use was almost entirely dependent on season, with wood being burned in the wet season and crop residues and cow dung being used instead in the dry season. A matched pair t-test found a significant difference between seasons in terms of water collection times (p = 7.4 x 10(-16)), with households spending more time and money obtaining clean drinking water in the dry season. Results indicate that seasonal differences in resource availability may reduce the proportion of households that meet the physical characteristics for maintaining a biogas digester by approximately 62% from wet season to dry season. Conversely, the greatest benefits of digester use would be gained in the dry season, when dung could be returned to the soil as a nutrient-rich bioslurry, instead of being combusted as a dirty and inefficient fuel. Seasonality is rarely considered in feasi-bility studies, so we recommend that these factors should be built into future analyses.

AB Climate change and its effects are now a global challenge faced by everyone. To address climate change, many countries had studied into and set out strategies from energy-saving to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Since the 20th century, social economy had made remarkable progress, and work opportunities and business activities were mostly centered along urban areas, leading population to flow into cities - a low density expansion which was termed "urban sprawl". Whereas the concept of low carbon city was put forward amid the balancing of environment preservation against economy development, it was a wish of many administrations to achieve sustainable development whilst fulfilling environmental preservation. Once consumption and shocks to environment are reduced, the tension between economy development and environmental protection will be offered with solutions. In this research, it mainly engages residents of Shaanxi Province for questionnaire and survey. During the process, questionnaires sent out totalled 500, and 433 effective ones were collected back, accounting for 87% of the total. According to research result: (i) In hierarchy 2 evaluating construct, the most valued construct was low carbon life, following that respectively are: energy index, building and environment, green transportation, resource recycling; (ii) Among 20 evaluation indexes, the most valued 5 indexes are: low carbon education initiative, renewable resources, carbon management and promotion, greening area ratio, low carbon transportation means. Lastly, in light of research results, certain advices were put forward in the hope of assisting and guiding cities to set out appropriate environment planning strategy, and to advance towards the goal of low carbon and sustainable development.

AB In populated downtown areas, a floor system with secured environmental performance is needed to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) and global warming problems related to buildings. This study aims to assess environmental impacts on a novel double-beam floor system subjected to high gravity loads. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to investigate the environmental impacts on the reduction in construction materials by calculating global warming potential (GWP) in the structural design phase. For different structural systems, the environmental performance was compared based on the GWP, and the contributions of structural elements to the GWP in each structural system were analyzed. The rotational constraints induced by the beam-end concrete panel can significantly reduce the GWP of the double-beam floor system by up to 13.8% compared to the conventional beam-girder system. Thus, the double-beam floor system reinforced with the concrete panel can be a candidate for eco-friendly structural systems in underground structures requiring high gravity loads. This result provides valuable findings that the structural effect on the rotational constraint of the concrete panel was quantitatively evaluated by converting it into an environmental impact.

AB Achieving sustainable urban environments is a challenging goal-especially in existing cities with high percentages of old and obsolete buildings. This work analyzes the contribution of roof refurbishment to sustainability, considering that most roofs are currently underused. Many potential benefits of refurbishment can be achieved, such as the improvement of the energy performance of the buildings and the use of a wasted space for increasing green areas or for social purposes. In order to estimate the degree of the improvement, a vulnerable area in Castellon (east Spain) was selected as a case study. A thorough analysis of the residential building stock was undertaken. Using georeferenced information from the Cadastral Office we classified them according to typology, year of construction and roof type. Some refurbishment solutions were proposed and their applicability to the actual buildings was analyzed under different criteria. The theoretical benefits obtained in the neighborhood such as energy and carbon emissions savings were evaluated, together with the increase of green areas. Moreover, other social uses were suggested for neglected urban spaces in the area. Finally, a more accurate analysis was performed combining different solutions in a specific building, according to its particular characteristics.

AB We examine the role of some firm-level factors, such as energy-saving effort (ESE) and fixed asset characteristics (FACs, including fixed asset scale (FAS) and fixed asset efficiency (FAE)), in promoting energy saving (EnSv) for Chinese large firms that subject to a goal-setting regulation. We argue that the achievement of energy-saving goals is positively associated with ESE and FAS, and is the strongest when FAE is controlled at a moderate level. We also claim that whether firms comprehensively adopt the two major behaviors is related to their resource stocks. Basically, higher level of resource stocks corresponds to better energy saving performance. In terms of behavioral adoption, firms with lower resource stocks are more likely to make a full effort to achieve energy-saving goals, while firms with higher resource stocks may underestimate the status quo and reduce the adjustment of asset allocation, and even ignore the creation of energy-saving capabilities. We show empirical supports for our arguments using detailed data from Chinese government websites and the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database for 510 firms in 2009. Our study highlights the micro-level contributors to energy saving and unveils unsustainability problems behind the success reflected in the data. Finally, we suggest that decision-makers should stress firm resource endowments when making policies and encourage firms to build comprehensive competence in pursuit of environmental performance.

AB In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the residential building sector is a major energy consumer and greenhouse gases emitter that plays a key role in achieving the country's environmental objectives. The purpose of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the most important policy instruments in decreasing the final energy consumption and direct CO(2)emissions of Luxembourgish households. To this end, we developed the LuxHEI model, which is an enhanced and upgraded version of the well-known French simulation model Res-IRF. This variant has also been adjusted to the particular problems of a small country with growing economy and a quickly increasing population. The LuxHEI model goes beyond standard energy-economy models by incorporating global warming as a decision-making factor. The model outcomes reveal that in 2060, and compared with the no-policy baseline scenario, the most aspirational policy mix enables energy savings of 42% and emission reductions of 60%. However, in none of the projections, the residential building sector meets the national energy and climate targets on time. From the results we can draw the following policy implications: for a significant improvement of the sector's energy efficiency and sufficiency, the implementation of a remediation duty for existing buildings and the tightening of the performance standards for new constructions, together with the application of a national carbon tax, are crucial.

AB The current paper presents a methodological framework that is able to evaluate the carrying capacity of protected areas where various human activities, apart from recreation and tourism, take place. The proposed framework converts the energy and product consumption into land required to satisfy those needs (Ecological Footprint) and compares them with the current land uses and available land (Biocapacity), in order to calculate carrying capacity. To facilitate the evaluation, an algorithm that calculates the Ecological Footprint, the Biocapacity, and the Carrying Capacity of the protected area under study by introducing 48 inputs was developed. The inputs were related to the evaluation of individual indicators assessing energy and product consumption of human activities such as households, tertiary sector, municipal buildings, public lighting, private and public transportation, and tourism. A new unit is introduced, the "equivalent person," since the anthropogenic activities within the boundaries of the protected area contribute in a dissimilar way to the total land requirements. The framework is applied, as case study, in the National Park of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (NPEMT), Greece, with a view to validate and improve its applicability. Within the NPEMT, habitats of significant biodiversity and ecological value are in coexistence with extensive human activities (urban, rural, tourist, light industrial). The study area covers up to approximately 73,000 ha and its population is estimated at about 29,000 people. The Carrying Capacity of the NPEMT according to the current consumption patterns was estimated at 39,193 equivalent residents, which was higher than the current equivalent residents (36,960), indicating a potential for tourism development at the NPEMT. The Ecological Footprint of the NPEMT was estimated at 181,324 Gha or 4.9 Gha/pers(eq), slightly higher than the European mean (4.69 Gha/pers(eq)). Among activities, households and private transportation (with approximately 79% and 10%, respectively), among land use, agriculture, livestock, and CO2 emissions (with approximately 36%, 30%, and 30%, respectively), and among products, beef, fruits/vegetables, and beverages (with approximately 22%, 15%, and 14%, respectively) were the main contributors of the total Ecological Footprint of the NPEMT. The area of the NPEMT is able to meet the needs of its population provided that the consumption patterns will be stable. The results encourage the expansion of tourism development, as the tourism activity within the NPEMT is limited compared to other adjacent domestic destinations.

ID IMPACTS
AB Increasing temperatures due to global climate change and the urban heat island effect pose a rising threat to the reliability and security of energy systems. To support climate preparedness and resilience planning for the electric sector, this study (1) proposes a framework for assessing the vulnerability of electricity systems in the remainder of this century using the Washington metro area as a case study, (2) evaluates the cost-effectiveness of deploying rooftop photovoltaic (PV) technology, and (3) employs quantitative probabilistic risk analysis in order to enhance adaptation planning and decision making. The results indicate that by the end of the century, the probability of power outages could increase 70-fold in the Washington metro area under the business-as-usual scenario. If the peak load on the electrical grid is cut by three quarters, the probability of outages could rise 20-fold. This reduction is achievable by installing solar panels on building roofs. There is about 136.45 m2 of suitable roof area for solar PV in the Washington metro area, which could add a generation capacity of 13.02 GW to the existing power system. The benefits of using rooftop PV to reduce the peak load on the power grid by 25%, 50%, and 75% are significantly greater than the costs when environmental impacts are considered. The cost-effectiveness of PV strategies may increase in the future because of declining material and installation prices and because of increased social cost of carbon emission.

AB Intelligent use of rural residential land and sustainable construction is inexorably linked to cost; however, options exist that are eco-friendly and have a positive return on investment. In 2011, a research residence was built to evaluate various land-use and sustainable components. This Texas house has subsequently been used for both residential and research purposes. The purpose of this case study was to evaluate break-even construction considerations, to assess environmental impacts, and to evaluate qualitatively efficacy of sustainable options incorporated in the research residence. Some of the specific components discussed are home site placement (directional positioning); materiel acquisition (transportation); wood product minimization; rainwater harvesting; wastewater management; grid-tied solar array power; electric car charging via a solar array; geothermal heating and cooling; insulation selection; windows, fixtures, and appliance selection; and on-demand electric water heaters for guest areas. This study seeks to identify the impact of proper land use and sustainable techniques on the environment and return-on-investment in rural areas. Break-even and 15-year Net Present Value (NPV) analysis at 3% and 5% cost of capital were used to evaluate traditional construction, partially sustainable construction, and fully sustainable construction options for the case study house, which was built sustainably. The additional cost of sustainable construction is estimated at $54,329. At 3%, the analysis suggests a 15-year NPV of $334,355 (traditional) versus $250,339 million (sustainable) for a difference of $84K. At 5% cost of capital, that difference falls to $63K. The total estimated annual difference in carbon emissions is 4.326 million g/CO(2)e for this research residence. The results indicate that good choices for quick return-on-investment in rural construction would be the use of engineered lumber, Icynene foam, and Energy Star windows and doors. Medium-term options include photovoltaic systems (PVS) capable of powering the home and an electric car. Sustainable construction options should positively affect the environment and the pocketbook. Regulations and code should require adoption of short-range, break-even sustainable solutions in residential construction.

AB Environmental performance objectives in terms of energy consumption and carbon emission targets can be found in various building norms and certifications schemes. These targets are often dependent upon the building program (e.g. office), but independent from its context; the same value is imposed for two buildings of the same program regardless of other possibly influential characteristics (e.g. solar exposure). Such targets serve as references against which a project's performance is measured following its description and assessment using an evaluation tool. In this paper, we question the suitability of this procedure within the context of urban planning by asking: should a district-level performance objective be allocated in a `uniform' manner or through a `contextual' approach, capable of capturing specificities throughout the site and allowing compensation between areas? To address this question, a novel method is proposed to distribute a site-level target differently between lots presenting distinct conditions over the site, through a combined top-down and bottom-up approach. The method relies on the exploration of databases of lot-specific scenarios, generated by varying design parameters that have not yet been fixed at the planning stage, such as building shape and construction materials. Applied on a case-study district in Switzerland, the contextual method results in differentiated lot-specific targets that are up to 11% away from the uniform targets. Although apparently small, these shifts can increase the feasibility of reaching the site-level target by up to 30%. Such information can guide the design team towards defining a coherent environmental strategy and making informed decisions.

AB The main objective of this paper was to analyze the status quo of energy consumption in rural Henan and identify the driving forces governing energy consumption based on the STIRPAT model. Potential driven factors of energy consumption including power of agricultural machinery, effective irrigated area, investment, income, total value, and per capital living space were selected to build the extended stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model, where ridge regression was applied to eliminate multicollinearity. The estimation results show that all the factors are positively related to rural energy consumption in Henan. The effective irrigated area is the maximal driven factor of energy consumption in rural Henan. Per capital living space, peasant household investment, power of agricultural machinery, total value of agricultural output, and per capita income all contribute to rural energy consumption growth in Henan. Finally, we propose policies that can be applied to mitigate future energy consumption in rural Henan.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the sustainable impact of adaptive reuse of shopping malls built during communism in Kosovo. Design/methodology/approach The present study uses qualitative research using semi-structured interviews with architects, civil engineers, real estate developers and facility managers. Findings The study found that it is the predominant opinion of respondents that the economic impact of adaptive reuse of old shopping malls in Kosovo is reflected through extension of useful life of the malls, lower cost of reuse vs demolition, economic and tourism development of the neighborhood, job creation and increase of property prices in the surrounding area. In addition, the study found that it is the predominant opinion of respondents that by adaptive reuse of old shopping malls, the revitalization and social dynamism of the surrounding area will be improved and collective memory and identity of these shopping malls will be extended, including the increased traffic, space utilization and security. The study concludes that operational CO2 emission of the old shopping malls will be reduced after their sustainable adaptation and also the embodied energy of the building materials will be reused. Originality/value The study is the first qualitative study about the impact of adaptive reuse of old communist style commercial centers in Kosovo.

AB Planning urban expansion under the interconnected Sustainable Development Goals requires a systemic analysis of its environmental impacts. The benefits of integrating the widely used system analysis tool life cycle assessment (LCA) into the planning process tool environmental impact assessment (EIA) are described in the literature. However, not many applications of such an integration have been conducted. The aim of this study is to refine the framework for integrating LCA into the process of EIA and to apply this framework to an example of urban expansion: Masdar City in Abu Dhabi. The integrated framework builds on the complementarity between the scope and assessment steps of the tools and assesses the impacts for the areas of protection: human health, ecosystem, and resources. The framework is then applied to the vehicles, buildings, and infrastructure in the city's first development phase (DP1). Major environmental stressors include the loss of existing desert ecosystem and the utilization of non-renewable sources of energy at various development stages of DP1. Substituting natural gas-based electricity with solar power could potentially save 46% of current carbon emissions. To mitigate the land transformation impacts, construction of close-to-nature artificial habitats, and increased use of low-carbon fuels is suggested.

AB Faced with implementing policies that seek to improve the energy efficiency of housing and reduce the impact of CO2 emissions, several countries are introducing (unilaterally or by international agreement) energy certification systems that allow the effects of these policies to be evaluated. This study aims to compare the energy efficiency certification systems in Spain and Chile, identifying convergent and divergent parameters, enabling the existing gaps to be identified and improvements noted for both systems. To do so, 20 sample dwellings in Santiago de Chile were evaluated, along with the local calculating tools in both countries. The analysis considered the aspects of regulation, its reach, the characterization of the models and the necessary indicators. The comparison identified, among others, differences such as obligatory implementation of the system, a study of the existing buildings in the focus area, the prevailing indicators for evaluating the effects of the buildings, the low incidence of mixed energy systems in the Chilean system and the possibility of proposing and evaluating improvements in the Spanish system. As a result, higher energy requirements and greater CO2 emissions were identified in the Chilean system, reaching differences of 42 kWh/m(2)/year in consumption and 14 kgCO(2)/ m(2)/year in emissions with regard to the Spanish qualification. The results of this comparison have facilitated the identification of improvements that will increase the evaluation standards of the Chilean system.

AB Replacing traditional building materials with renewable and sustainable materials such as timber can control environmental pollution such as energy consumption and carbon emission in the whole life cycle of a building, which is conducive to energy conservation and environmental protection. How to design timber structure building better is the focus of this study. This study takes timber structure building as the research object, evaluates the building energy consumption and CO2 emission with the whole life cycle concept. The comparative ecological advantages of timber structure building are obtained by comparing and analysing the brick-concrete structure building with equivalent thermal performance. Then by analysing the different spaces of timber structure building design, the design suggestions of energy saving and carbon reduction such as reducing the platform area appropriately and increasing the number of building floors are proposed when designing timber structure buildings.

AB Energy crisis and increasing demand for green energy to acute pollution has forced the engineers, architects and scientists to adapt green materials for structural applications. In this context, conventional building materials are extensively investigated using life cycle estimations, thermodynamic models, CO2 emissions, and energy demands and many other criteria. Selection of smart materials for thermal energy efficient architecture on the bases of various thermo-physical properties (density (), thermal conductivity (K) and specific heat capacity (C-p)) in relation to the engineering requirements (energy stored (Q(S)), energy density (Q), rate of heat transfer (q), utilization factor () and mechanical load) is a crucial as well as a tedious task. In this context, we have employed quality function deployment (QFD) in combination with VlseKriterijumska Optimisacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) technique to determine the ranks and rank indices (degree of closeness) of important materials. The weights of thermo-physical properties of materials for hot (: 17.72%; C-p: 45.14%; K: 37.14%) and cold weather (: 29.32%; C-p: 65.42%; K: 5.26%) applications are depicted using QFD. Our results enlighten that low conductivity materials should be preferred for hot areas applications while for cold areas the scenario is reversed. Furthermore, wood and asphalt sheet are found to be the best materials for hot and cold areas, respectively.

AB In an effort to slow the progress of climate change, the current scientific community has focused on the reduction of greenhouse gases in order to limit the global average temperature inflation to less than 2 degrees C. The improvement of thermally controlled construction materials can potentially result in lower energy homes/reduced emissions, and lowering the thermal conductivity of insulation materials improves home energy efficiency. Nanoporous insulation foams impart a drastic decrease in thermal conductivity but many polymer properties must be assessed to produce these materials. Passive phase-change materials also represent another key energy-saving device to control heat flux within a living space. Research into unique polymeric systems provides a novel means of encapsulation or creating polymeric cross-linked matrices to prevent leakage and improve mechanical robustness. These two areas of polymer research in architecture represent key advancements for construction materials aimed toward energy savings and energy-related emissions control.

AB The emissions associated with purchased electricity in a specific location are determined by the emission factors attributed to power generators on the electrical grid serving a facility. Averaged, flat rate emission factors consider a representative fuel mix in a region, usually averaged over many years, and are often used in conjunction with building energy analysis. Time-varying power generation data is needed to determine the effect of power generation dispatch on marginal emission factors, but such data is rarely publicly available. This work provides a critical comparative analysis of two types of temporal emission factors with the goal of understanding how indirect emissions relate to the energy usage of commercial buildings in the U.S. Every building's consumption of electricity also varies temporally, so we use representative electric loads on an hourly basis using stock building model simulations. The methods compared are: (1) regional factors provided by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power generation data and (2) city-specific factors derived from the Locational Emissions Estimation Methodology (LEEM). The emissions resulting from alternate calculation methods are presented for, NOx, and SOx. These locally specified, hourly resolved methods of indirect emissions calculation were found to differ from the simple flat rate emissions calculation method (4%-20%). On an annual basis, the difference in calculated emissions using hourly emission factors versus annually averaged LEEM and EPA factors differed by less than 2%, indicating that they provide similar information on an annual basis.

AB With the aim of improving the building energy efficiency, different technologies have been developed that optimize the use of solar energy in building envelope and avoid warming of urban areas. Chromogenic devices based on materials whose optical properties can be reversibly modified by an external stimulus have become relevant among these technologies. The facade coating can have different types of texture or color that determine specific optical properties, including absorptance, which defines the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the material with respect to the incident radiation. In the present work, the influence of the optical properties of two types of exterior facade coatings on the building energy demand is analysed: a belitic cement synthesized in the laboratory through a low energy and low CO2 emissions process and a brick representative of a typical building masonry, presenting the former a more polished surface and lighter color than the latter.
   This study has focused on determining the parameters that optimize the use of the optical properties of the studied coatings in the building energy efficiency. The results show that the N-S orientation and the uninsulated wall suppose greater impacts on the energy demand by the coating change. In turn, the effect of coating change is remarkable in the climates studied, but it is in the temperate A3 climate where lower demands are achieved, approaching those established for passive buildings.
   These parameters will be used for future studies with a new thermochromic mortar coating developed from belitic cement, analyzing its influence on the building energy demand.

AB This study aims to check the various possibilities of application of the double layer of the facade in the rehabilitation of industrial facilities in Serbia, with the aim of improving the energy performance of buildings and energy savings for heating and cooling. Industrial facility of Raska textile factory in city of Novi Pazar, Serbia, was taken as a model for this study. This facility needs to be adapted into the building for administrative purposes. Using the existing structural system of the building, the existing shell and infrastructure of the building, the scheme of Attire business functional areas of the building have been proposed, which defines the thermal zones in the building. The paper examined various modalities of double layer on the east and west facades of the building adding a curtain wall with single glass as the outer membrane. The results of the energy characteristics of the proposed rehabilitation of the building were obtained using a computer simulation program EnergyPlus and software DesignBuilder, based on climatic parameters of Serbia and the parameters of necessary thermal comfort defined by the Regulations on energy efficiency in buildings and in accordance with standard EN 15251. The criteria on the basis of which the valorization of improving the energy efficiency of the building would be performed are the thermal comfort, the required amount of energy for heating and cooling the facility and reduction of CO2 emission.

AB The rooftops of Cardiff City Hall were surveyed to establish potential areas for commercial-scale photovoltaic (PV) system design. The orientation and tilt angles of suitable unshaded roof areas were measured for accurate PV system simulation. The performance of two PV technologies, polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) and heterojunction with intrinsic thin layers (HIT) was investigated. From the analysis of simulation, experimental, environmental and economic data, HIT was found to be the best-performing PV technology for system installation. Superior performance of HIT under diffuse sunlight conditions, typical of the UK climate, was demonstrated. Additionally, the maximum power temperature coefficient, verified during experimental work, was lower than the p-Si alternative (-0.28 against -0.50%/degrees C). Electricity demand data for City Hall were analysed and 8.1% of the annual electricity demand (solar fraction) could be supplied by an 88 kWp HIT PV system. The HIT PV system modelled would significantly improve the energy performance of Cardiff City Hall, avoiding >40 000 kg carbon dioxide emissions annually. The levelised cost of energy from one array (B, 0.11 pound/kWh) was less than the current day tariff rate for grid import (0.1173) pound. The economic and environmental benefits of well-designed high-efficiency PV systems in the UK at commercial scale are also demonstrated.

   DESIGN; FLOORS; MASS; CLAY
AB Lightweight aggregate concrete blocks are being increasingly demanded for construction purposes. These materials, whose principal purpose of their use is to retard the flow of heat, have many other important benefits over normal concrete blocks. Some of these benefits consist of less dead weight of structure, fire resistance, and more endurance against weathering conditions of the environment; therefore, due to high thermal resistance of them, there is a growing tendency in their use in many cold climate zones, especially in earthquake-prone areas. To describe thermal phenomenon through the walls, dynamic thermal circuit modeling was applied in this process. Heat-insulating properties of lightweight concrete blocks were studied by means of thermal resistance parameter. Thermal mass, as another parameter, was investigated for energy-efficient building design. The conduction, convection, and radiation of heat transfer phenomena are being taken into account in this investigation. The abundance of volcanic pumice in the East Azarbaijan Province of Iran is believed to be a remarkable source of lightweight material to produce lightweight aggregate concrete blocks sized 0.2 m x 0.2 m (variable) x 0.4 m, with two equal cavities. East Azarbaijan with its harsh winter weathering conditions was selected for practical data inputs. To obtain realistic results, a typical house of 100 m(2) in area was chosen for heat loss calculation and economic studies. Ratio of heat loss through external walls constructed with lightweight aggregate concrete blocks to that of the ones using normal concrete blocks for the same condition would be less than 0.35 that shows high potential of energy saving for heating. Furthermore, during a winter month, gas consumption, CO2 emission, and living expenses could be decreased as much as 700 kg, 1,925 kg, 625,990 IRR, respectively. Therefore, using lightweight concrete could be economically beneficial, environmentally favorable, and suitable for earthquake-prone areas.

ID RETROFIT; IMPACT; LIFE
AB One of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada is the buildings sector, with over 30% of national energy end-use occurring in buildings. Energy use must be addressed to reduce emissions from the buildings sector, as nearly 70% of all Canada's energy used in the residential sector comes from fossil sources. An analysis of GHG emissions from the existing residential building stock for the year 2010 has been conducted for six Canadian cities with different climates and development histories: Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax. Variation across these cities is seen in their 2010 GHG emissions, due to climate, characteristics of the building stock, and energy conversion technologies, with Halifax having the highest per capita emissions at 5.55 tCO(2)e/capita and Montreal having the lowest at 0.32 tCO(2)e/capita. The importance of the provincial electricity grid's carbon intensity is emphasized, along with era of construction, occupancy, floor area, and climate. Approaches to achieving deep emissions reductions include innovative retrofit financing and city level residential energy conservation by-laws; each region should seek location-appropriate measures to reduce energy demand within its residential housing stock, as well as associated GHG emissions.

AB Active sub-slab depressurization (SSD) systems are an effective means of reducing indoor radon concentrations in residential buildings. However, energy is required to operate the system fan and to heat or cool the resulting increased building ventilation. We present regional and national estimates of the energy requirements, operating expenses and CO2 emissions associated with using SSD systems at saturation (i.e. in all US homes with radon concentrations above the EPA remediation guideline and either basement or slab-on-grade construction). The primary source of uncertainty in these estimates is the impact of the SSD system on house ventilation rate. Overall, individual SSD system operating expenses are highest in the Northeast and Midwest at about $99 y(-1), and lowest in the South and West at about $66 y(-1). The fan consumes, on average, about 40% of the end-use energy used to operate the SSD system and accounts for about 60% of the annual expense. At saturation, regional impacts are largest in the Midwest because this area has a large number of mitigable houses and a relatively high heating load. We estimate that operating SSD systems in US houses, where it is both appropriate and possible (about 2.6 million houses), will annually consume 1.7 x 10(4) (6.4 x 10(3) to 3.9 x 10(4)) TJ of end-use energy, cost $230 (130 to 400) million (at current energy prices), and generate 2.0 x 10(9) (1.2 x 10(9) to 3.5 x 10(9)) kg of CO2. Passive or energy efficient radon mitigation systems currently being developed offer opportunities to substantially reduce these impacts.

AB Representative data is used to describe the mass and energy flows and cal bon dioxide emissions during the manufacture of rime and limestone products. The evaluation includes not only the flows directly involved but also tile primary energy and material inputs which occur when tracing the system back to the sources of raw material and primary energy. The balance boundaries are chosen so that individual stages in tile manufacturing process can be examined first, and then these can befitted together like building blocks to form product manufacturing lines or: for example, a lime works by extending the area covered by the balance. All the partial processes, starting from excavation and covering the manufacturing process, are included quantitatively in the balance in respect of energy expenditure, raw materials expenditure and carbon dioxide emissions produced, i.e. the cumulative energy and material inputs and cumulative CO2 emission are determined for each case. Characteristic numbers are defined for assessing the products or process stages. The procedure described above is illustrated with the aid of an example and then carried out for all the manufacturing steps under consideration.

ID CONSUMPTION
AB According to the latest energy efficiency European directive (EED 2023/1791/EU), the expected energy renovation rate of at least 3% of the buildings' floor area each year towards nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEBs) is extended to include public buildings not only of the central government (as per the first EED 2012/27/EU) but also of regional and local authorities. This poses a great challenge, especially for Municipalities that often manage large building stocks with high energy demands. In response to this challenge, this paper presents the application of the so-called "typology approach" for conducting public buildings' energy renovation plans at the local level. A computational survey is initially introduced to decide the optimal set of building-stock clustering criteria among all possible combinations, involving the minimization of the RMSE index regarding the primary energy consumption of each building. For a representative building from each identified typology, the key performance indicators (KPIs) are computed for alternative energy-upgrading scenarios. Exploiting the IMPULSE Interreg-MED project tools, the KPIs from each representative building are at first extrapolated to all buildings of the examined stock and, finally, a gradual energy renovation plan is automatically produced based on user-defined decision parameters including the required annual renovation rate. The methodology is applied for the case of the Municipality of Hersonissos in Greece. For the specific 44-buildings' stock it was found that the optimal clustering set included four criteria, building use, construction year, heating, and a cooling system, leading to 15 building typologies. Finally, assuming a 7% renovation rate per year, a 12-year gradual renovation (nZEB transformation) plan is obtained foreseeing an 85% CO2 emissions' reduction.

AB The buildings sector is the single most important end-user of final energy in the European Union and a significant contributor to carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. This work focuses on a review of available data that are used to calculate the annual emissions from electricity generation in the European Union and quantify indirect emissions from the use of electricity in the buildings sector. Historical data since 1990 are used to derive simple empirical correlations for the time evolution of emissions factors related to electricity production in each Member State of the European Union. More recent trajectories using data from the last ten years are also presented. The derived correlations can be easily integrated in building stock modeling and national studies to facilitate forward-looking projections of emissions from electricity use in buildings. The EU-27 averages 0.2883 kgCO2-eq/kWhel, ranging from 0.0456 kgCO2-eq/kWhel in Sweden up to 1.0595 kgCO2-eq/kWhel in Poland. As a case study, the derived coefficients are then used to quantify the indirect emissions from the electricity consumption attributed to the building stock in each EU Member State. The calculated total EU-27 GHG indirect emissions attributed to electricity consumption amounted to 215 MtCO2-eq for residential buildings and 201 MtCO2-eq for non-residential buildings. In addition, the proposed correlations are used to demonstrate how they can be used for more realistic future projections of emissions towards the national targets in Greece and Poland.

AB In this study, solar thermal desalination methods were developed to enhance the day to day efficiency of solar distillers by improving their portability and water purification properties. The performance of solar stills is highly contingent on environmental factors, making it essential to address these variables. To achieve this, a doubleslope single basin solar distiller (DSBD) was upgraded by incorporating a partially coated absorber plate with ZnO/PVC/Bioactive nanocomposite (ZPBN), which was subsequently examined for its impact on drinking water production from multiple perspectives, including energy, exergy, environmental, and economic considerations. The ZPBN material was synthesized using the solvent casting technique, and its properties were comprehensively characterized through various analytical methods. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed a regular crystalline lattice structure amidst an amorphous background, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed its surface performance. The presence of ZnO nanoparticles within the PVC and bioactive matrix imparted enhanced thermal characteristics to the DSBD, including higher temperatures, specific heats, and thermal stability compared to the ZPBN. The study demonstrated that the introduction of ZPBN significantly increased drinking water yield by up to 126% due to its enhanced absorption of solar energy. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of the DSBD improved by 0.44%, while its exergy efficiency decreased by 0.25% when compared to a conventional double slope single basin solar distiller (CDSBD) under the tropical climate conditions of Vijayawada, India. In terms of energy matrices, the ZPBN-coated basin area exhibited minimum and maximum energy payback times of 6.55 years and 0.15 years, respectively. Over its lifetime, the DSBD was found to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2.97 tonnes and offered the lowest cost per litre, amounting to $0.0360. The incorporation of ZPBN on the absorber plate within the DSBD resulted in excellent environmental and energy economies, with values of 4.640 kWh/$ and $83.210, respectively.

AB At global scale, the building sector accounts for 40% of total energy end use and almost 35% of greenhouse gas emissions. This makes it one of the most important sectors to focus on for reaching the 1.5-2 degrees C target of the Paris Agreement, to enhance energy security of supply and to alleviate energy poverty. The European Union (EU) is often seen as a leader in climate governance, which is also true for energy efficiency. The improvement of energy performance of buildings has been part of EU public policy for more than 50 years, making the EU a pioneer in the policy domain. Based on a semi-structured review of the scientific literature (N = 90), this paper is aimed at drawing the lessons from research on governance of energy-efficient and zero-carbon buildings in the EU. As for the findings, there is a multitude of policy instruments developed on different levels of governance, more or less integrated and managed by different actors and no single instrument is sufficient to stimulate energy-efficient and zero-carbon buildings. Five key challenges are identified in the governance literature examining the transition towards energy efficiency and zero-carbon buildings. An ambiguous leadership, heterogeneity of implementation, lack of incentives, limitations of non-regulatory policies and market-based instruments, and limited diffusion between governance levels. We also conclude that most policy instruments focus on new buildings which is problematic since the greatest challenge in the transition is the renovation of the large existing building stock.

AB The large-scale development of urban building photovoltaics (PV) has become an important avenue for cities to achieve building energy conservation, emission reduction, and carbon neutrality. Assessing the solar energy potential of urban buildings plays a crucial role in the installation and overall planning of urban building PV systems. However, due to the vast number and diverse types of urban buildings, individual building calculations can be both labor-intensive and inefficient. Therefore, batch processing of buildings after classification is a feasible approach. Previous assessments of solar energy potential in building clusters mainly focused on typical clusters or standard geometric areas, but all urban building types were covered. Based on this, this paper proposes a method for defining Building Complexes with a Single Land Use Nature (BCSLUN) by combining geographical distribution and urban land use characteristics. Furthermore, population density, building density, compactness, and land use characteristics are selected as features, and a method that combines K-means clustering and random forest classification is proposed to complete the classification of building complexes. Taking the central urban area of Xi'an, China as an example, 5,804 building complexes are classified into four building types. The cross-validation classification accuracy is 0.99, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.94. Based on Rhino modeling, the global solar radiation on the surface of each building complex was calculated. The annual surface global radiation of the four building types is 11,442.73 MWh, 2,734.71 MWh, 13,923.81 MWh, and 67,215 MWh. The violin-box plot shows a significant classification effect, which proves the rationality of the proposed classification method. Finally, a potential map based on solar radiation from urban building surfaces is generated. Building complex classification can quickly and accurately estimate the solar energy potential of urban buildings, providing decision-making support for the large-scale construction of urban building PV. Moreover, this method can be easily applied to other cities.

AB The construction and building materials sector are becoming increasingly concerned about sus-tainability and environmentally friendly materials/composites. One of these developed compos-ites is called engineered cementitious composite (ECC), and it has the ability to reduce carbon and energy impacts on the environment in addition to its remarkable performance, such as con-trol cracking and ultra-high ductility. Over the previous years, scientists have made coherent ef-forts and activities to create a greener ECC. These efforts can be mostly categorized by the utiliza-tion of more cost-effective and environmentally friendly binders, fillers, and fibers. This review focuses on the utilization of environmentally friendly binders called limestone calcined clay ce-ment (LC3) as well as greener fibers in creating greener ECC. The fresh, mechanical, and sustain-ability performance of LC3-based ECC are comprehensively discussed in this study. Based on the existing studies, it is concluded that LC3-based ECC has a higher strain capacity and better self-healing capability. It reduces the carbon footprint and embodied energy compared to the OPC-based ECC. Overall, the review aims to promote the use of ECC-LC3 in construction projects and encourage further research in this area. Further research should focus on enhancing the long-term mechanical and durability performance of LC3-based ECC.

AB The building sector accounts for a significant proportion of global energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions. It is important to explore technological advances to curtail building energy usage to support the transition to a sustainable energy future. This study provides an overview of emerging and sustainable technologies and strategies that can assist in achieving building decarbonization. The main technologies reviewed include uncertainty-based design, renewable integration in buildings, thermal energy storage, heat pump technologies, thermal energy sharing, building retrofits, demand flexibility, data-driven modeling, improved control, and grid-buildings integrated control. The review results indicated that these emerging and sustainable technologies showed great potential in reducing building operating costs and carbon footprint. The synergy among these technologies is an important area that should be explored. An appropriate combination of these technologies can help achieve grid-responsive net-zero energy buildings, which is anticipated to be one of the best options to simultaneously reduce building emissions, energy consumption, and operating costs, as well as support dynamic supply conditions of the renewable energy-powered grids. However, to unlock the full potential of these technologies, collaborative efforts between different stakeholders are needed to facilitate their integration and deployment on a larger and wider scale.

AB As the poverty of conventional energy and the abundance of renewable energy coincide in Tibetan plateau, the on-site renewable energy supply is essential for alleviating energy poverty and decarbonizing buildings. For the on-site supply, a prominent issue is the daily and seasonal mismatch between energy supply and demand. To formulate the mismatch issue and achieve near-zero energy in Tibetan plateau, the on-site energy supply and demand characteristics of an office building are investigated based on modelled photovoltaic (PV) power generation with PVsyst software and electricity consumption data from on-site research, and the impact of energy storage on mismatch alleviation is examined in terms of both short-term and trans-seasonal storage. The results reveal that, without energy storage, the carbon emission reduction rate (alpha) is limited to 58% due to temporal mismatch, when PV generation equals electricity demand. Energy storage can effectively alleviate the daily mismatch, and alpha can be increased to 93% by short-term storage. Moreover, the seasonal mismatch is pronounced in the plateau as the enormous heating energy consumption occurs in winter while cooling is not required in summer. It is demonstrated in this study that trans-seasonal hydrogen storage could eliminate the seasonal mismatch and further achieve near-zero energy buildings.

AB Embodied emissions in construction materials make a relevant contribution to carbon emissions worldwide. While this has been broadly recognised, only little attention has been paid to the role of load-bearing structures in this regard, and if so, mainly limited to assessments of individual structures. For analysing the global warming impact of engineering structures in a wider context, dynamic material flow analysis is deployed in this study. The future stocks and flows of structural materials and their associated embodied emissions in German residential buildings are quantified based on a mass-balance consistent multi-layer model, which relates the stocks in use, their inputs, outputs and determinants, such as the building lifetime, the population or the useful building floor area per capita. A scenario analysis under combination of different emission mitigation measures is performed, among them a gradual replacement of the comparatively large masonry structure stock share by timber structures, and a general downsizing of structural material quantities. The results show that when applied to a realistic extent, such measures could contribute with about 4% to 8% to the German average target mitigation rate required for achieving emission neutrality in 2045.

AB Energy efficiency in high-density urban areas is increasingly gaining more attention as the energy crisis and environmental issues worsen. Urban morphology is an essential factor affecting the energy consumption and solar energy development potential of buildings. In response to the research gap of previous studies that only analyzed building energy consumption or solar energy potential from a single objective, this paper aims to combine the two objectives of block-scale building energy consumption and solar development potential to explore the joint influence of urban residential morphological elements on correlations between the two. By investigating and summarizing 100 sample cases of Wuhan city blocks, 30 urban residential block prototypes were constructed. The correlations between the leading morphological indicators of the blocks with the building energy consumption and solar energy potential of the residential prototypes were quantified, respectively. The study results show that at certain floor area ratios, the highest solar power generation can be achieved with a mixture of high-rise slabs and high-rise towers, but the building energy intensity level is relatively high; combining building energy consumption and solar power generation, the residential block form of high-rise towers and low-rise villas has incredible energy-saving potential. In addition, the regression analysis results show that three block form indicators, namely the roof-to-envelope area ratio, compacity, and site coverage, have the most prominent influence on building energy intensity and solar power generation, and they all show positive correlations. This study can provide suggestions for urban residential planners and managers to promote urban energy conservation at the design stage.

AB A single-family house was designed as a new middle-income green residential building in the Sultanate of Oman, according to criteria defined by the green building certification system EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies), developed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is a member of theWorld Bank Group (WBG). The design was accomplished through the free cloud-based tool of EDGE. With respect to a base design for the Sultanate of Oman, the green home design achieved savings of 40.86%, 20.22%, and 26.39% in energy, water, and materials (Embodied Energy), respectively. In addition, a saving of 35.48% in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was estimated. Based on the completed green building design, four green building-normalized metrics were used to quantify the efficiency of the base case and the design case in terms of the consumption of resources and polluting emissions. These efficiency metrics are: Carbon Emission Index (CEI), Energy Performance Index (EPI), Water Consumption Index (WCI), and Embodied Energy Index (EEI). Out of these green building performance metrics, the EPI is directly provided by EDGE, while the other three are introduced here as additional useful indicators that allow fair evaluations and comparison with other buildings, due to their less stringent dependence on the floor area or the number of occupants.

AB As the built environment is among the main contributing sectors to climate change, it is needed to investigate new paradigms to push decarbonization efforts towards the ambitious objectives defined internationally. It is a shared understanding that shifting the perspective from the single building to the district perspective is required to fully take into consideration the complexity of all interactions undergoing within the built environment, thus the concept of Positive Energy District emerged as a district with annual net zero energy import and net zero CO2 emission working towards an annual local surplus production of renewable energy. In this framework, this paper explores the investigation of the potential for achieving the level of Positive Energy District in a group of non-residential buildings in Balaguer, Catalonia, Spain. These buildings, occupying 8,825 m2 in the city centre, require significant refurbishment for improved energy performance. The analysis includes building energy modelling and simulation, renovation studies, several alternative balance calculations, and carbon emissions assessment. The paper also considers mobility and embodied energy and their impact on energy/carbon bal-ances. The results show that Positive Energy Districts carbon and primary energy balances are not met with rooftop PV installations when retrofitting an existing district towards the Positive energy target but further significant PV areas (roughly + 50%) are required to meet merely the use stage balances: negative results are traced when mobility and embodied energy are computed. A formulation alternative to the simple mathematical balance to facilitate the diffusion of Positive Energy District as catalyst of urban decarbonisation could be needed, including context factors and alternative systems (e.g., rating systems).

AB As the energy crisis and environmental problems are exacerbated, rural carbon emissions have gradually attracted increasing attention. Meanwhile, rural areas have the important function of ecological carbon sequestration, so the research field of carbon emissions has gradually expanded from urban to rural areas in recent years. To systematically sort out the research progress regarding low-carbon rural areas, a total of 583 papers published during 2013-2023 were acquired through the bibliometric analysis method from the "professional field of science of building technology" in the core database of Web of Science. Then, the research stage, author cooperation, institutional cooperation, national distribution, and keyword co-occurrence of "low-carbon rural areas" were analyzed via data visualization analysis software VOSviewer, and the current hot issues, such as carbon emission calculation list and elements, carbon emission measurement method/model, and energy saving and emission reduction paths, were further summarized and reviewed. The statistical analysis results show that: (1) in most of the current research on rural carbon emissions, geographical characteristics and rural carbon emissions have been rarely analyzed; (2) there is a lack of interdisciplinary research, e.g., less cooperation with geographic information or other disciplines; (3) the differences and characteristics of rural carbon emission factors in different economies and regions have rarely been analyzed. Based on the analysis, this research pointed out that future research can be comprehensively carried out in formulating rural carbon emission inventory, establishing a multi-scale and multi-regional statistical method and so on. This research also provides a comprehensive analysis and summary of the existing research on the structure and model of carbon emissions in low-carbon rural areas and also presents the problems that need to be paid attention to in the future research, pointing out the research direction for relevant scholars.

AB Urban public buildings carbon emissions exhibit an upward trend and have a large potential in carbon emission reduction. The analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors for urban public buildings carbon emissions is essential in formulating effective policies for carbon reduction, meeting commitments to peak carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. This study takes China's urban public buildings carbon emissions as the research object, employing methods such as spatial autocorrelation analyses, kernel density estimation analyses, and the LMDI decomposition methods to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and regional disparities in carbon emissions from 2006 to 2019. Furthermore, it quantifies the contributions of driving factors to the spatiotemporal changes in urban public buildings carbon emissions. The results show the following: (1) Urban public buildings carbon emissions among provinces are consistently increasing, indicating an overall upward trend. The spatial distribution highlights significant regional disparities. (2) The spatial characteristics of urban public buildings carbon emissions were basically stable. The eastern coastal regions demonstrate a high-high cluster, while the western regions exhibit a low-low cluster. The overall cluster evolution showed a decreasing trend from east to west. (3) Per capita urban public building area, economic density, urbanization rate, and population size serve as driving factors for carbon emissions from urban public buildings, while energy efficiency and energy consumption intensity act as inhibitory factors. The findings of this research can assist policymakers in getting a deeper comprehension of urban public buildings carbon emissions and providing a scientific basis to formulate appropriate carbon emission reduction policies.

AB Integrated energy system (IES) is characterized by high self-consumption ratio of on-site generated renewable energy, high efficiency of conventional energy utilization and possesses a significant flexibility in its operation. This overall, constitute to the foundation of low-carbon communities. Considering economic and environmental benefits, this paper proposes a two-layer co-optimization model with the upper layer optimizing the IES configuration and the lower layer optimizing IES operation. A community in Beijing is introduced as a case study to analyze the benefits of IES and compared with the conventional energy system. Multiple scenarios are researched, including (a) IES for low-carbon communities with PV roof area limitation, (b) IES for each of the four building types with PV roof area limitation, (c) IES for low-carbon communities without PV roof area limitation. The results indicate that the optimized IES for community can reduce the cost by 25% and CO2 emissions by 32% per year by considering the limitation of roof area for the PV system. Without this constraint, the costs and emissions could be reduced by 20% and 62%, respectively. In addition, IES is more appropriate for office and commercial buildings since their load characteristics allow for load shifting and community-level IES costs and emissions are 8% and 10% lower than building-level due to the complementary of community load. This study provides suggestions for the IES planning and application in low-carbon community.

TI Staged renovation and the time-perspective: Which other metric should be
   used to assess climate-optimality of renovation activities?

AB With the sudden threat of gas supply interruption through the Ukraine-Russian war, the importance of improving buildings' energy efficiency has become even more relevant. Mainly during 2022 and 2023, there was an intensive process to launch a recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, to assure favourable policy framework conditions. In this context, the current paper addresses the following question: How does the consideration of staged renovation change the view of cost-optimal building standards and related building renovation assessments? For that, this paper analyses the staged building renovation and the time perspective when they are performed related to cost-optimal building standards. The workflow relies on the following methods: (1) cost-optimal methodology and global costs calculation and (2) mixed-integer optimisation to derive optimum timing of staged renovation under household budget constraints. The analysis consists of a country comparison (Spain, Germany and Sweden) and an evaluation of different energy efficiency measures. The main conclusion is that in staged renovations, the cost-optimal variant was in many cases the climate-optimal one when using the metric cumulative CO2 emission. Although the metric "cumulative CO2 emissions" is not sug-gested by the EPBD yet, this metric represents the depth and time perspective of renovation activities. Therefore, in order to speed up building stock decarbonisation cost-optimal methods alone are not sufficient to increase buildings' energy efficiency and climate neutrality in a fast way. In addition to that, considering households' budget as optimisation variable can be an effective to assess the time when renovation activities are performed.

AB Extent and spatial patterns of settlements and infrastructures strongly affect resource demand of national economies worldwide. Their influence on final energy and CO2 emissions is almost as large as that of gross domestic product (GDP).
   Built structures, i.e. the patterns of settlements and transport infrastructures, are known to influence per-capita energy demand and CO2 emissions at the urban level. At the national level, the role of built structures is seldom considered due to poor data availability. Instead, other potential determinants of energy demand and CO2 emissions, primarily GDP, are more frequently assessed. We present a set of national-level indicators to characterize patterns of built structures. We quantify these indicators for 113 countries and statistically analyze the results along with final energy use and territorial CO2 emissions, as well as factors commonly included in national-level analyses of determinants of energy use and emissions. We find that these indicators are about equally important for predicting energy demand and CO2 emissions as GDP and other conventional factors. The area of built-up land per capita is the most important predictor, second only to the effect of GDP.

AB Urban area is a major source of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Urban green space (UGS) is an essential element to increase carbon sequestration directly and reduce emission indirectly. In this study, the net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was monitored in order to enhance the carbon sequestration function of UGS and promote urban low-carbon development. Based on the Sentinel-2 L2A satellite images, meteorological data, and vegetation type data in 2019, we used the optimized Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model to estimate the NPP values of UGS types including attached green space, park green space, protective green space, and regional space in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Xi'an. The NEP values were evaluated based on NPP and soil heterotrophic respiration (R-H) to quantify the vegetation carbon sink capacity. The accuracy test shows that the estimated NPP values based on the optimized CASA model are effective. The results indicate that the average NPP values (1008.5 gC & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;a(-1)) and vegetation carbon sink capacity (771.49 gC & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;a(-1)) of UGS in Beijing rank first among the cities, which is followed by the values in Guangzhou. The regional green space and park green space in five cities function as carbon sinks with high NPP values and have vegetation carbon sink capacity, whereas the attached green space in Shanghai and Xi'an as well as the protective green space in Guangzhou and Xi'an function as carbon sources. Moreover, the NEP distribution shows obvious spatial aggregation characteristics, that is, the high NEP values of UGS are clustered in mountainous forest areas in the west and north of Beijing, Northeast Guangzhou, and South Xi'an whereas the low NEP values are mostly concentrated in the urban built-up areas under strong influences of human activities. This research provides a new method for NPP and NEP estimation of UGS at the city scale and the scientific basis for the improvement of the vegetation carbon sink capacity of UGS.

AB Maintaining good Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) in English schools in terms of overheating and air quality is important for the health and educational performance of children. Improving energy efficiency in school buildings is also a key part of UK's carbon emissions reduction strategy. To address the trade-offs between energy efficiency and IEQ, a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework based on an English classroom stock model was used. The aim was to determine robust optimal school building interventions across a set of criteria (including child health, educational attainment and building energy consumption) and settings (comprising different climate scenarios, construction eras, geographical regions and school geographical orientations). Each intervention was made up of the pairwise combination of an energy efficiency retrofit scheme and an IEQ improvement scheme. The MCDA framework was applied to the school building stock in England. This study shows that the framework represents a transparent approach to support decision making in determining the optimal school building intervention from different perspectives. The optimal interventions included measures that improved IEQ and resulting indoor learning environments, such as external shading, or increased albedo and internal blinds, for the particular set of interventions, criteria and stakeholders in this study. The results of the MCDA analysis were sensitive to the preferences elicited from stakeholders on the relative importance of the criteria and to the range of interventions and criteria selected for evaluation.

AB Urban areas experience numerous environmental challenges, among which the anthropogenic emissions of heat and carbon are two major contributors, the former is responsible for the notorious urban heat effect, the latter longterm climate changes. Moreover, the exchange of heat and carbon dioxide are closely interlinked in the built environment, and can form positive feedback loops that accelerate the degradation of urban environmental quality. Among a handful countermeasures for heat and carbon mitigation, urban irrigation is believed to be effective in cooling, yet the understanding of its impact on the co-evolution of heat and carbon emission remains obscure. In this study, we conducted multiphysics urban climate modeling for all urban areas in the contiguous United States, and evaluated the irrigation-induced cooling and carbon mitigation. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of urban irrigation on the potential heat-carbon feedback loop, with their strength of coupling quantified by an advanced causal inference method using the convergent cross mapping algorithms. It is found that the impact of urban irrigation varies vastly in geographically different cities, with its local and non-local effect unraveling distinct pathways of heat-carbon feedback mechanism.

AB Understanding the imbalance of carbon emissions in the urban residential building (URB) sector is beneficial for equitable and effective emission reduction policies. However, carbon imbalance in URB and its major driving factors remain unclear. Therefore, according to the Kaya identity and Zenga index, this study aims to analyze the imbalance in carbon emissions and carbon emission unit area of URB from 2005 to 2019. The results represent the following: 1) Although the overall carbon emission unit area reached its peak value (36.17 kgCO2/m2) in 2011, the overall carbon emission of URB did not reach the peak value, arriving at 0.86 BtCO2 in 2019; 2) the obvious imbalance of carbon emission and carbon emission unit area was led by the population and energy consumption unit area, respectively; 3) Compared to the difference in economy, the difference in climate had a larger impact on inter-group imbalance of carbon emission unit area without heating. In summary, these results and provided policies facilitate future formulation of fair and effective provincial decarbonization responsibility and emission mitigation implementation policies.

AB Buildings are currently responsible for 39% of global energy related carbon emissions. Thus, carbon reduction in the construction industry is crucial to global climate issues. This study contributes a real-time operational carbon emission prediction method for the early design stage of residential units based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN model was trained based on a dataset with 2000 real residential units focusing on typical cases in northern China, particularly in Beijing, which is a significant energy consumption area. The R2 values of the operational-stage heating and electricity carbon emissions in the validation dataset reached between 0.91 and 0.98. The trained model based on this method can provide the real-time prediction of the carbon emission potential of proposed residential units to buttress architects to make scientific design decisions. The model was then validated on new cases that varied in the total area, rooms, orientation, window locations, and window sizes. The performance of the CNN model is verified by comparing the results with the output of an EnergyPlus model. While the variation trends of the output results of the two methods are found to be consistent, the CNN model results still have certain deviations from those of the EnergyPlus model. Consequently, the proposed method can reflect the variation of operational-stage carbon emissions due to the change of the floor layouts of residential units, and has a faster speed and higher convenience than the simulation-based method.

AB Solar energy has gradually become one of the priorities to sustainable energy supply, driven by the urgent need for energy security and the imminent threats of climate change. Diverse photovoltaic (PV) technologies can be applied and integrated with various industries to significantly increase the usage and output value of different assets, such as land appreciation within limited space. In order to quantitatively evaluate the overall performance of various integrated applications of PV, a comprehensive benefit evaluation index system, involving economy, environment, society, and land use, was proposed and applied to three selected PV projects, PV-JWZ, PV-NHPZ, and PV-DPBD, namely, in Tianjin, China. The results indicated that these projects all have great development potential due to their remarkable benefits of energy saving and emission reduction. Therein, the total income of PV-JWZ within 25 years is equal to 1441.9 million CNY, which is dominated by extra income from industrial convergence; PV-NHPZ can offset 231.8 t/(a center dot hm(2)) CO2, attributed to its larger installed capacity; while PV-DPBD would acquire strong policy support for distributed PV to further promote the zero-carbon buildings, owing to lower land consumption of 1.4 hm(2)/MW. By revealing the effectiveness and feasibility of various PV projects, this study could provide a theoretical reference for the promoting and planning various integrated applications of PV in different areas, according to local conditions.

AB Food insecurity can be considered as a significant cause to instability in some regions around the world. Grain production utilizes a multiple of inputs, such as: water resources, fertilizers, pesticides, energy, machinery, and labor. In China, grain production has led to huge irrigation water use, non-point source pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. It is necessary to emphasize the synergy between food production and ecological environment. In this study, a grain Food-Energy-Water nexus is delivered and an eco-efficiency sustainability evaluation metric is introduced, Sustainability of Grain Inputs (SGI), for investigating the sustainability of water and energy use in grain production across China. SGI is constructed by using generalized data envelopment analysis to comprehensively incorporate differences of water and energy inputs (including indirect energy use contained in agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural film, and direct energy use such as the electricity and diesel used for irrigation and agricultural machinery) in different regions across China. Both water and energy are considered by the new metric at the same time, which is built on the single resources metrices that are often used in the sustainability literature. This study evaluates the water and energy use of wheat and corn production in China. Wheat production uses water and energy sustainably in Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan; Corn production has the highest combined sustainability index in Shandong, Jilin, Liaoning, and Henan. In these areas, the grain sown area could be increased. However, wheat production in Inner Mongolia and corn production in Xinjiang rely on unsustainable water and energy inputs, and their grain sown areas could be reduced. The SGI is a tool that researchers and policy makers can use to better quantify the sustainability of water and energy inputs to grain production. It facilitates formulating policies about water saving and carbon emission reduce of grain production.

AB Mine water can be a renewable and economical source of geothermal and hydraulic energy. Nine discharges from closed and flooded coal mines in the Laciana Valley (Leon, NW Spain) have been studied. Various technologies for the energy use of mine water, as well as the influence of factors such as temperature, the need for water treatment, investment, potential customers and expansion capacity, have been evaluated by means of a decision-making tool. It is concluded that the most advantageous option is an open-loop geothermal system using the waters of a mountain mine, the temperature of which exceeds 14 ? and whose distance to customers is less than 2 km. A technical-economic viability study for a district heating network designed to supply heating and hot water to six public buildings in the nearby town of Villablino is presented. The proposed use of mine water might help areas that have been greatly affected socioeconomically by the closure of the mines and has other advantages compared to conventional energy systems, such as the reduction of CO2 emissions.{GRAPHIACAL ABSTRACT}

ID RESOURCES
AB The goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality requires major systemic changes in the energy supply sector. As one of the major non-carbon-based energy sources, geothermal energy is characterized by large reserves, stability, and reliability. This paper summarizes the current situation of geothermal resource endowment and industrial development in China. Based on this, a system dynamics model of geothermal industrialization is established, and the potential of geothermal industrialization and carbon emission reduction in China is predicted. The prediction results show that the growth rate of geothermal heating and cooling areas in the next 40 years will follow a trend of acceleration followed by deceleration. China's geothermal energy heating and cooling area will reach 11.32-14.68 billion m(2) by 2060, an increase of about 9-12 times compared to 2020. The proportion of geothermal heating and cooling area to the total building area in China will reach 13.77-17.85%. The installed capacity of geothermal power generation will reach 14,452.80-20,963.20 MW by 2060 under the scenario with electricity subsidies. The proportion of geothermal energy in China's primary energy consumption structure will reach 3.67-5.64%. The annual carbon emission reduction potential of the geothermal industry will reach 436-632 million tons, equivalent to 4.41-6.39% of China's carbon emissions in 2020. The results of this study can provide a reference for the healthy and high-quality development of China's geothermal industry and help to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.

AB Rural residential buildings in Northeast China commonly use the traditional structure of Stove-Kang, causing severe air pollution when burning straw for heating. This study proposes a new perspective for assessing air pollutant emissions from straw combustion based on building heat load calculations. It develops a mathematical relationship between the heating load of rural houses and the heat generated utilizing burning straws by conducting a questionnaire survey to investigate the types of residential buildings and fuel burning time. The emission factor method is employed to estimate the total emissions of air pollutants. The questionnaire survey showed that the proportions of traditional buildings (TBs), energy-saving retrofit buildings (ERBs), and new energy-saving buildings (NEBs) in Northeast China are approximately 48.28%, 37.44%, and 14.28%, respectively. After estimation by this method, the daily pollutant emissions from ERBs and NEBs are reduced by 58.23% and 73.57%, respectively, compared to TBs. In addition, the total emissions of pollutants produced by heating in rural areas of Liaoning, Jilin, and Hei-longjiang provinces are 844.719 & PLUSMN; 70.752, 907.257 & PLUSMN; 75.991, 593.560 & PLUSMN; 23.422, 637.503 & PLUSMN; 25.156, 627.864 & PLUSMN; 63.389, and 674.347 & PLUSMN; 68.082 Tg. As the energy performance of buildings improves, consumption of solid fuels and emissions of air pollutants significantly reduces. This is an effective measure to accelerate the construction of the new socialist countryside and imple-ment the development strategies of "Peak carbon dioxide emissions" and "Carbon neutrality". Finally, the study proposes indicators of farmhouse heating pollution per building area, which can quickly and accurately estimate pollutant emissions from straw burning in Northeast China and provide new ideas and methods for related research.

AB China has made remarkable achievements in reducing carbon emissions in recent years. However, there is still much reduction room before achieving carbon neutrality. In Beijing, the capital of China, it is a strategic choice to respond to global climate change by promoting green and low-carbon development. This paper calculates the carbon dioxide emissions of key industries in Beijing and analyzes the temporal evolution trend of carbon emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions in Beijing before 2030 are predicted based on the grey prediction GM (1,1) and BP neural network model. The effects of factors of carbon dioxide emissions are discussed using the threshold regression model under different economic conditions. The results show that energy consumption intensity, GDP per capita, and the ownership of civil cars have a positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions, while the number of permanent residents and urban green space areas have a negative impact on carbon dioxide emissions. These findings of carbon emission prediction and influencing factors contribute to carbon reduction path design. Related policy implications on carbon emission reduction are put forward from the aspects of promoting industrial upgrading, accelerating the construction of advanced economic structures, optimizing transportation structures, and strengthening green building development.

AB Energy conservation and carbon emission reduction in the building sector have become a global concern in combating environmental issues. To achieve this target, developing low-energy buildings becomes an integral approach. Different from the case-by-case design for public buildings, the geometrical construction form of residential buildings are roughly the same and can be concluded in several representative categories, which leads to several similar paths to achieve energy-saving targets for buildings belonging to the same category. Aiming to determine the applicable design schemes for each archetypal building, the architectural typology method and simulation-based method were used in this research. Furthermore, an optimisation step was done the design schemes from both energy and economic perspectives. As demonstrated in Ningbo city as a case, this research uses the number of floors, building shape coefficients, average floor areas, and window-to-wall ratios as classification factors based on previous research and proposed nine representative building archetypes. Subsequently, 512 (29) groups of design schemes combined from nine energy-saving measures were simulated for each building archetype. Considering the energy performance indexes as an energy-perspective constraint and the life-cycle cost of design scheme as an economic-perspective constraint, the design scheme was optimised. The limitation of this research is the neglect of immediate environment such as proximity to other buildings or natural elements such as trees that provided a subsequent research direction. Specifically, this research obtained optimal design schemes of energy-saving targets for individual residential building archetypes in China's hot summer and cold winter zone. Broadly, this research proposed a comprehensive method for individual building assessment and optimisation that could be further used for a urban-scale energy planning and prediction.

AB The United States (U.S.) and China are key to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and reaching carbon neutrality by around mid-century. Despite differences, carbon neutrality will be met more rapidly if the two countries coordinate and facilitate synergies in carbon-neutral technologies and policy development and implementation. Building on long-term pathway models in the U.S. and China, current emissions trends and sources, and a policy analysis, this paper puts forward a novel framework for U.S.-China coordination on carbon neutrality. The analysis reveals similar technology and policy pathways, policy gaps, and shared milestones for decarbonization in 2030, 2040, and 2050-2060. The main technological pathways focus on reductions in energy demand and non-energy-related CO2 emissions, decarbonization of electricity and fuels, and increases in electrification rates and CO2 sequestration. Given existing domestic policies and opportunities for further action, areas for coordination on carbon neutrality include common policy milestones; dialogue and technical exchange; research, development, and demonstration (RD & D); and international climate leadership. Despite escalated tensions between the U.S. and China, and challenges for climate cooperation, coordination between both countries on carbon neutrality is both possible and necessary.Key policy insightsCarbon neutrality will be met more swiftly if the U.S. and China coordinate and facilitate synergies in carbon-neutral technologies and policy.Despite the rise in geo-political tensions between the U.S. and China, coordination on carbon neutrality is both possible and necessary.An analytical framework for U.S.-China coordination on carbon neutrality, includes technology and policy pathways, and common milestones of key sectors' decarbonization for 2030, 2040, and 2050-2050.The two countries could coordinate on common policy milestones, dialogue and technical exchange, research and development, and international climate leadership.

AB Decarbonising and improving the energy efficiency of dwellings is a priority for climate and energy policy. However, integrated energy systems modelling, commonly used to inform decarbonisation pathways, typically does not capture the heterogeneity of the dwelling stock, particularly internal dwelling temperatures, a key determinant of the cost of switching to low-carbon heating and upgrading building fabric. Addressing this gap, this paper presents a new model of the residential sector within an energy systems optimisation model (ESOM), which is developed using an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) database and measured energy consumption data, allowing for the heterogeneous depiction of the housing stock. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which has committed to ambitious legally binding climate targets. The Irish residential sector, which represented 22% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2020, is characterised by poor thermal efficiency and high reliance on fossil fuels. The TIMES Ireland Model (TIM) is developed within a framework demonstrating cost-optimal pathways for energy supply, transformation, and demand sectors.The model is open-source, and the methodology outlined in this study is replicable for any country with an EPC database. The results presented are indicative of the type of insights that such modelling can provide and demonstrate that to meet climate targets, a rapid reduction in residential fossil fuel heating is necessary. The results show that deeper decarbonisation pathways require more thermal retrofits and electrical heat pumps, increasing the total cost of the energy system.The results explore the effect of internal temperatures, highlighting the importance of using empirical data for accounting for the rebound effect. Exemplifying the value of an integrated system modelling approach, deeper decarbonisation pathways place further costs on the electrical system.

AB This study established global warming potential(GWP) emission factors through a life cycle assessment on the operation phases of two different 1 kW polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems for residential buildings (NG-PEMFC, fed with hydrogen from natural gas reforming; WE-PEMFC, fed with hydrogen from photovoltaics-powered water electrolyzer). Their effectiveness was also compared with conventional power grid systems in Korea, specifically in the area of greenhouse gas emissions. The operation phases of the NG-PEMFC and the WE-PEMFC were divided into burner, reformer, and stack, and into water electrolysis and stack, respectively. The functional unit of each fuel cell system was defined as 1 kWh of electricity production. In the case of NG-PEMFC, the GWP was 3.72E-01 kg-CO2eq/kWh, the embodied carbon emissions due to using city gas during the life cycle process was about 20.87 %, the carbon emission ratio according to the reformer's combustion burner was 6.07 %, and the direct carbon emission ratio of the air emissions from the reformer was 73.06 %, indicating that the carbon emission from the reformer contributed over 80 % of the total GWP. As for the WE-PEMFC, the GWP was 1.76E-01 kg-CO2eq/kWh, and the embodied carbon emissions from photovoltaic power generation during the life cycle process contributed over 99 % of the total GWP.

AB In Europe, the recast of Directive 2018/2001 defined Renewable Energy Communities as innovative configurations for renewable energy sharing between different end user types. In this regard, this work aims to assess the benefits following the constitution of a Renewable Energy Community in the industrial area of Benevento (South of Italy), involving a mixed-use building and an industrial wastewater treatment plant. The alternative single end users' configuration has been also examined, and both solutions have been compared with the current state where the users' electric energy requests are fully met by the power grid. The users have been equipped with a 466 kW(p) photovoltaic plant, modelled in HOMER Pro (R), providing in input experimental meteorological data (global solar radiation and air temperature) collected by one of the weather control units in Benevento. Real data about users' electric energy demand have been gathered from their electricity bills, and when unavailable their electric load profiles on an hourly basis have been reconstructed based on the aggregated monthly data. Energy sharing has been proven to increase energy self-consumption and the users' self-sufficiency. Annually, the primary energy demand is reduced by 577 MWh (1.2 MWh/kW(p)), carbon dioxide emissions by 84 tCO(2) and operative costs by 101 kEUR.

AB PurposeThe inclusion of heritage dwellings in the UK decarbonization policies can contribute to cut operational carbon emissions from the building stock; this needs to be made a priority if net zero carbon targets are to be achieved. However, the energy and carbon savings potential of suitable retrofit interventions on this part of the stock is extremely variable and strictly intertwined with the range of baseline conditions of such dwellings. This study aims to propose a framework for interventions in traditional listed dwellings (TLDs) to improve their energy performance utilizing dynamic energy simulation (DES) of selected case studies (CSs) in the city of Brighton and Hove (South-East England).Design/methodology/approachTo achieve this aim, the study established a baseline scenario which provides a basis for the assessment of energy performance and thermo-hygrometric behaviour pre- and post-interventions and allows for comparison between different CSs under comparable conditions.FindingsPresenting a brief overview of the methodology adopted in this study, the paper describes the approach devised to generate such baseline scenario. The paper then compares the results obtained from simulation of normalized and baseline models with the status-quo energy consumption of the dwellings investigated (based on meter readings).Originality/valueThis analysis finally allows to highlight some key physical determinants of the baseline HEC which, in the following stage of research, proved to have a considerable effect also on the amount of energy and carbon savings achievable post retrofit interventions.

AB Energy saving in existing buildings is of vital importance. In this work, the characterization of housing stock in Spain for energy retrofitting purposes has been performed. The regulations in force when the existing stock was constructed (1980-2007) were considered to model the envelope and thermal systems of single-family and block housing. Building energy consumption and CO2 emissions were estimated for each type of dwelling and location, ranging from 44.2 to 130.6 kWh/(m(2)center dot year) (13.6-32 kg CO2/(m(2)center dot year)) for multi-family homes, and 85.5 to 213.5 kWh/(m(2)center dot year) (17.1-45.2 kg CO2/(m(2)center dot year)) for single-family homes. A global picture of the energy performance and emissions for 13 different climate zones was obtained with a total of 504 simulations. Retrofitting of the envelope allowed the reduction of consumption and emissions from 37.7% to 58%, depending on the climate zone. Energy consumption per square meter in block housing was lower than in single-family housing; nevertheless, single-family houses responded more effectively to energy improvement actions. Finally, non-renewable primary energy savings seem a better indicator of the improvement by retrofitting than the energy label. The building models designed in this work may serve as a reference for subsequent research concerning energy retrofitting and energy savings of housing stock.

AB With the implementation of dual-carbon and new human-centric urbanization strategies, the renovation of old buildings in China was inevitable. In this study, we establish the carbon emission values of retrofitting building from the perspective of carbon emissions, and propose a carbon accounting calculation method. Meanwhile, according to an economic viewpoint, we propose carbon emission evaluation indexes, including carbon increments, carbon emission intensity, carbon saving during the operation phase, and the static payback period of carbon increments. We retrofitted a building in an old residential area in Jinan, which both extended the building's life and met the energy consumption needs of modern buildings. Through the case study, the annual carbon emissions during the use phase were reduced by 80.64% after retrofitting, and the building materials generated carbon emissions during the materialization phase of 11.04 t CO2/a. Considering the carbon increment factor, the comprehensive carbon emission reduction was 71.43%. The carbon increment per unit of building area was 110.32 kg CO2/m(2), of which the carbon emission during the materialization stage accounted for 96.04%. Promoting low-carbon building materials and improving the energy efficiency would be an important means to reduce the carbon increments during building renovations. The static payback period for the carbon increment was 2.05 years, indicating that retrofitting measures were effective. Our work is informative for the development and quantitative assessment of low-carbon retrofitting programs for older buildings.

AB Green and low-carbon rural development (GLRD) is becoming an important way to explore sustainable development in rural areas of China. It is significant for the sustainable development of the rural economy and of society to build a rural carbon sink system, advocate low-carbon emissions in rural areas, and promote the development of rural green industries and rural transformation. In this study, the existing knowledge system of GLRD was analyzed using CiteSpace. Keywords related to GLRD and their occurrence frequency were identified using keyword co-occurrence analysis. The knowledge evolution stages of GLRD were explored using citation burst analysis. Thus, the evolution of the research related to GLRD was revealed. The summary of Chinese GLRD-related research literature shows that: (1) according to the CiteSpace analysis, the GLRD research can be divided into three stages: starting, rising, and expanding and deepening; (2) GLRD research has focused on low-carbon development, green development, and then green and low-carbon integrated development, thus forming three major research content systems; (3) GLRD's research content gradually became rich, as over time, the research focus became increasingly prominent and research integration was gradually strengthened; (4) the GLRD literature still has some limitations, e.g., nonunified measurement standards, insufficient research depth and practical significance, and relatively weak innovative policy research; (5) future research should strengthen the scientific evaluation and prediction of rural green and low-carbon functions. The industrial development pathways and regional characteristic modes of GLRD should be further studied. Innovative GLRD policies should be proposed to provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference for GLRD and construction.

AB In a previous work, a significant contribution to urban air pollution, related to fuel-fired heating systems, was recorded. Thus, the replacement of existing boilers for space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) production systems with high-temperature air/water heat pumps (which can operate with radiators, the most common terminals in the existing building stock), is proposed for the improvement of the urban air quality. Scenarios of substitution within the entire residential building stock of two Italian cities, Milan and Salerno, belonging to different climate zones and with their own thermophysical characteristics, were analyzed. For each of them, the consequences of the replacement intervention on emission reduction, primary energy savings and lower CO2 production were evaluated. The results show that reduction of primary energy consumption, evaluated at design outdoor temperature and for the present generation mix, varied between 34% and 54% in Milan and between 43% and 60% in Salerno, for two values of renewable fraction in electricity generation. The reduction of CO2 production was in the range 30-52% in Milan and 39-58% in Salerno, respectively. The only unfavorable case occurred for Milan for a completely non-renewable electricity generation scenario. The replacement intervention, which implies a significant decrease of emissions of pollutants in urban areas, is unobtrusive to citizens, since the heat pumps (HPs) are coupled with current radiators, without the internal distribution system being modified.

AB In accordance with national regulations, the renovation of the residential sector is an urgent task for achieving significant reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the existing building stock. Social housing is particularly in need of such interventions, given the higher vulnerability of its inhabitants and its crucial role in furthering social welfare and environmental sustainability objectives. Both passive and active strategies have proved their efficacy in advancing towards these goals and also in mitigating increasing fuel poverty in low-income families. However, to optimize the best combination of such retrofit strategies, advanced optimization methodologies can be applied. Here, a multi-objective optimization methodology is implemented by a genetic algorithm (aNSGA-II) coupled to EnergyPlus dynamic energy simulations. Then, the energy consumption of the optimal solution is considered by means of EnergyPLAN simulations for the further application of active strategies. The two-step method is tested on a relevant case study, a social housing building in Rome, Italy. Results show that the applied method reduced the energy demand by 51% with passive strategies only. Active strategy implementation allowed for a further reduction of 69% in CO2 emissions and 51% in energy costs. The two-step method proved effective in mitigating fuel poverty and decarbonizing the residential sector.

AB Of the numerous effects of human activity with a direct impact on changes in the environment, one of the main activities is construction, which generates approximately 33% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and con-tributes to an increase in environmental impact. At present, interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact. Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75% of carbon emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement routes were located according to the types of transport used and the location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level. The impact of the building in the production, construction, de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use of the three tools -LCA, BIM and GIS -allowed us to establish that the highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix, which contribute to the sustainable development of the city.

AB Water scarcity is a current problem in many parts of the planet and there is a worldwide concern about water availability to meet future water demand. In countries like Brazil, where most of the electricity is produced by hydroelectric power plants, water scarcity directly impacts energy production. The water-energy nexus is directly related and impacted by CO2 emissions and its climate consequences, which calls to a broader approach: energy-carbon-water nexus. In this context, the Sustainable Water and Energy Consumption (SWEC) Program was developed to mitigate water and energy supply problems in a railway company in Brazil. The actions took place in four main areas: (a) users conscientization, (b) consumption diagnosis, (c) indicators for evaluating water and energy consumption, and (d) evaluation of implementing alternative cleaner water and energy sources. The per capita consumption of water and energy were reduced by 10% and 19%, respectively. Permanent results were achieved by the SWEC Program, such as the acquisition of two photovoltaic systems with a total capacity of 96.5 kWp. The investment made provided an average monthly reduction in energy consumption of 56% in 2022. This work contributed to the UN Agenda 2030 and the findings may help companies and industries, and other institutions, such as universities and schools, to improve their water and electricity consumption.

DE Carbon budget; Buildings; Climate neutral; Net -zero; Building stock
AB Challenging climate goals demand immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions for long-term temperature stabilization. Given the nearly linear relationship between warming and cumulative net emissions, the carbon budget approach is a useful tool to quantify remaining carbon allowances for countries, sectors, and even buildings. The built environment plays a crucial role in today's carbon emissions and future reduction potentials. Although much progress has been achieved towards energy efficient buildings, less attention has been given to the impact of materials put in place. Furthermore, the construction sector lacks of quantified reduction efforts and time horizon limits to clearly define a climate neutrality pathway. This article proposes a definition of yearly targets until 2050 for the operational and embodied carbon of buildings in line with a global 1.5 degrees C carbon budget and the Swiss climate strategy. The proposed targets are then compared with the impact of current practices and future technical developments. Gaps between targets and practices are quantified and discussed to better understand the upcoming challenges of the Swiss construction sector. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Green buildings desire low CO2 emission and high indoor air quality (IAQ), which, however, are inherently conflicted on energy consumption and cannot be achieved simultaneously in air conditioning-based ventilation methods. One alternative can be combining building-integrated renewable energy and CO2 capture technology to remove CO2 from stale indoor air and return CO2-depleted air to save air conditioning's (AC) energy demands. Despite the great potential, developing such a system remains challenging owing to the complex mass-energy exchange between the two subsystems, which has been oversimplified in previous research. This study for the first time developed an integrated solar-driven indoor air CO2 capture system and unveiled the dynamic mass-energy balance while considering selective air recirculation. Specifically, multi-variate analyses are conducted to evaluate the proposed system's overall performance, characterized by CO2 capture capacity, air quality enhancement and energy-saving potential. A scenario analysis covering different crowdedness and room areas is also conducted to obtain optimal design configurations for practical implementations. Results show that for one example case of a 40 m2 room with 39 occupants, the proposed system with optimal configuration captures 40.655 kg CO2 per day, controls the indoor CO2 concentration below 800 ppm and saves 24.082 kWh (38.18%) cooling energy by selectively recirculating clean post-captured air. This study sheds light on the rational design of a renewable hybrid system for enhanced indoor air quality, CO2 emission reduction, and energy saving, all of which are preferred in establishing a smart, sustainable and comfortable city.

AB The aim of this study was to present factors shaping biodiesel production in Poland influenced by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU). The performance of Polish biodiesel producers was analyzed. A regression model was built to identify the factors that impacted biodiesel production in Poland. The Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) was the main source of information about Polish biodiesel farmers. The FADN is the most comprehensive and detailed source of economic and agricultural data in Poland. Changes in the number of biodiesel producers in the Polish market were analyzed with the use of indicators. In the last stage of the study, the impact of selected variables on the performance of rapeseed farms was determined in a regression analysis. The second source of information was Eurostat data, which provided information about pure biodiesel production in the European Union (EU) countries from 2004 to 2019. The biggest producers of pure biodiesel in the European Union are Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. Poland is also an important producer of biodiesel in the European Union (EU). Both descriptive statistics and statistical analyses are presented. First, we used descriptive statistics to present changes in pure biodiesel production in the European Union. Second, we used statistical analyses to present factors shaping the economic performance of biodiesel producers in Poland. The study demonstrated that the number of rapeseed producers in Poland has increased and that farm performance has improved during the period analyzed. Rapeseed farms have increased their land area and the value of fixed and current assets. The land area under rapeseed cultivation has increased after Poland joined the EU, which suggests a positive response to a growing demand for biofuels.

AB The fast-growing construction industry and residential buildings in Bahrain create massive energy and environmental demands. Therefore, Bahrain has set a national renewable energy target of 5% by 2025.The novelty of this study is investigating the feasibility of using rooftop photovoltaic systems, Fed to the national grid, in residential buildings (Khalifa Town, Bahrain) - located in arid zone - combining architecture aesthetics, social acceptability and functionality. The assessment of the rooftop area and the PV system modeling was carried using AutoCAD and PVsyst software. Consideration was given to design aesthetics and the functionality of having PV panels on the roof, without losing the use of the roof for social gathering and activities. Our results show that installing 17 kW - PV panels, for each of 1,724 villas in the town, will produce annual solar electricity of 44,953 MWh, which is sufficient to meet about 43 % of the total town's electricity needs. This rooftops installation will cut CO2 emission by 34,794 tons, i.e., reducing 21 % of the town's total CO2 emissions.The study shows that the payback will be 9.6 years if the government purchases each kWh of solar electricity for 29 fils (USD cent 7.5). Establishing feed-in-tariff policy (FIT) will reduce the payback period and accordingly boost local PV manufacturing and create more green - collar jobs.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The purpose of this research is to estimate the renovation potential of a city's building stock and evaluate the environmental impact reduction and greenhouse gas emission reduction realized by clustered renovation. These reductions are compared to the climate goals for 2050 by the city of Leuven, i.e., 81% reduction in CO2-eq. compared to 2011 to support the development of an optimal renovation strategy for the city. Methods The building stock of Leuven is analyzed and subdivided into various clusters of buildings with a similar renovation potential. This paper presents the existing status of one cluster consisting of terraced buildings built between 1946 and 1970 and assesses its required renovation measures using a life cycle approach by applying the Belgian LCA method for buildings. The environmental impact of this cluster and the potential reductions obtained by the renovation are upscaled and compared to the city climate goals. Based on these results, the total impact of this cluster on the greenhouse gas emissions of Leuven is calculated and the most impactful renovation measures identified. Results and discussion The results reveal that renovating the walls, floors, and roofs of the houses in this cluster in Leuven (representing ca. 5% of the stock) can lead to a reduction in CO2-eq. emissions of 0.9 to 1.9% compared to the emissions by Leuven households in 2011. This estimate ignores the improvement of the airtightness and the renewal of heating systems. So, higher reductions may be possible. The renovation impact of each of the building elements is evaluated separately, indicating that the highest improvements can be obtained by improving the insulation level of the walls. A sensitivity on the original state of the building has been performed by assuming the absence of (a small) insulation layer in the original roof state. This reveals a significant higher CO2-eq. reduction potential due to renovation. Conclusions The results demonstrate the appropriateness of the clustering approach in estimating the greenhouse gas emissions of a certain housing type and the potential contribution of renovating these to reduce the city greenhouse gas emissions. By extending this analysis to all identified clusters, the full potential of renovating the housing stock in Leuven can be estimated and can help in setting priorities in the overall goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Sludge management accounts for a large share of economic costs and energy consumption in wastewater treatment and has become an important challenge for urban sustainability. Accurately predicting regional sludge generation by incorporating spatial characteristics to find carbon reduction potential can help improve the sustainability of wastewater treatment and formulate tailored mitigation strategies. This is especially true in China, which along with the world's largest wastewater treatment capacity, also faces rapid growth in sludge generation, insufficient disposal capacity, and low recycling rates. In this study, data from 3,495 wastewater treatment plants were used to screen sludge driving factors in 338 Chinese cities, and a random forest regression model was used to predict future sludge generation and associated carbon emissions at the provincial level under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. The results showed that GDP, built-up area, and carbon content of foods had relatively high q-values (above 0.5). Indicating that economic development, urban form, and food consumption were the major factors influencing sludge generation. By 2060, total sludge generation in China is expected to be between 195% and 241% of the 2017 total in the five SSP scenarios. Improved disposal methods should be implemented to reduce carbon emissions in regions that have stable sludge growth, while fast-developing areas should focus on sludge reduction. In Central and Western China, it may be possible to control sludge generation at the source given expected changes in dietary structure and urban compact development change, while in Eastern China greater use of anaerobic digestion and sludge-to-resource treatment may be more effective. Combining anaerobic digestion and low carbon disposal methods could reduce about 50 Mts GHG emissions in China by 2060.

AB The adoption of phase change materials (PCMs) is a promising solution for the improvement of building energy performances and indoor comfort, and the integration of geopolymer concrete (GPC) allows recycling materials and reducing the demand for raw materials in concrete production. Both materials contribute to reducing the carbon dioxide emission in the building lifecycle. In this frame, this paper proposes a complete numerical approach for selecting the optimal wall package made of GPC and PCMs in a Mediterranean climate. The first step of the method consists of a parametric analysis for evaluating the incidence on energy performance and thermal comfort of the main designing variables: insulation thickness, air cavity type and its thickness, and PCMs type. Then, assuming the discomfort hours as a limiting constraint, a multi-objective optimization is applied to a subset of solutions for determining the Pareto front solutions. The advantage of the proposed methodology is the combined evaluations of multiple variables with a simplicity in execution; for this reason, it is useful for other researchers aimed at studying innovative solutions. According to obtained results, the better exposure for the proposed wall package is the north or northeast one. The minimization of the cooling energy demand requires the adoption of two PCMs, on internal and external sides, with melting temperature of 26 degrees C. The optimization of yearly performance requires the adoption of the maximum insulation level on both sides and a not-ventilated air gap between the modules. The cooling and heating energy need can be reduced, respectively, by around -29% and -57%, compared to a reference configuration with vacuum insulation panels and thermal transmittance of 0.4 W/m(2) K.

AB Climate is a key element in building design. The determination of adequate climate zoning is crucial for achieving building energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. In this study, a cluster analysis method was applied to develop new thermal climate zones for building envelope thermal design in China. In total, three different cluster analysis methods, including k-means, average-linkage, and Ward's clustering, were considered. The analysis indicated that the average-linkage clustering was more appropriate for this study, and the elbow method could not accurately determine the best number of categories of average-linkage clustering. Further analysis showed that the unsupervised cluster processes may generate an unavoidable redundancy category and, to obtain precise results, supervision may be necessary in some contexts. Finally, China was classified into 10 climate zones. The North China plain and Qinghai-Tibet plateau are classified into two independent climate zones, and Turpan and Bayanbulak were classified into two newly defined climate zones different from their surrounding area in the new definition. Quantitative analysis indicated that the new zones were more precise when compared to the current ones, which can provide more precise climate information and contribute to formulating more precise standards and policies related to the thermal design of building envelopes in the future.

AB Rooftop solar photovoltaics (RSPV) are critical for megacities to achieve low-carbon emissions. However, a knowledge gap exists in a supply-demand-coupled analysis that considered simultaneously RSPV spatiotemporal patterns and city-accommodation capacities, a pivotal way to address solar PV intermittency issues. Here, we developed an aggregated model for an RSPV + system by linking building-level potential assessment to dynamic optimization of building-related flexible loads. Taking Beijing, the capital city of China, as case in point, we show that annual RSPV potential in Beijing's Greater-Metropolitan area amounts to 15.4 TWh, all of which could be accommodated environmentally friendly and cost-effectively through the smart operation of electric vehicles and air conditioners equipped with thermal energy storage (TES). Additionally, the RSPV + system would reduce the 8.6 GW transmission capacity otherwise required for increasing electricity demand for 2035 in Beijing. The analysis offers an important reference for sustainable RSPV development in mega-cities in China and other countries globally.

AB Food product drying is used to keep food products preserved for a long period and reduce post-harvest losses. Many industries dealing with food drying employ traditional drying systems that use traditional fuel for drying processes. Solar drying systems may be integrated with traditional industrial drying systems to save energy and reduce carbon emissions. The primary goal is to explore the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of indirect type solar drying technology integrated with electric heaters as per the requirement of an industrial drying system in six cities throughout India. RETScreen solar drying model is intended to analyze energy production, solar fraction and savings of energy, costs, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, financial feasibility, and various risk factors for the solar drying model in various locales. Sun drying project's economic viability is proven by measurements such as the simple payback period (SPP), internal rate of return (IRR), and equity payback period (EPP). This study's findings provide a clear vision for investors in the food drying sector to build their system in a specified area so that investors may maximize their profit while also supporting the environment by lowering carbon emissions. The simulation result of the presented scenario reveals that utilizing a 100 m(2) solar air heater annually saves the maximum energy in Bangalore (220,283 kWh), followed by Tiruchchirappalli (190,795 kWh) and Lucknow (182,486 kWh). Hanumangarh achieves a minimum energy savings of 150,548 kWh. Payback period for keeping a temperature of 40 degrees C with a 29.4 kg/s air flow rate is between 1 and 2 years. The largest value of EPP and SPP is found in Hanumangarh i.e., 0.56 years and 1.9 years respectively, while the minimum value of EPP and SPP is found in Bangalore i.e., 0.36 years and 1.3 years, respectively. The solar fraction can be enhanced further by expanding the surface area of the solar collector. It may also be concluded that the government must offer at least 50% incentives to make such installation practicable.

AB Efficient use of energy in the construction sector is a pillar of the European Union's 2050 climate protection goals, yet legislation makes no explicit reference to urban morphology or building form, which are recognized as key to energy performance in buildings. Rapidly changing energy standards and new requirements for on-site energy production demand a vigorous scrutiny of established urban typologies that are largely the product of an older energy regime. The research explores a set of 312 building shapes with floor-to-area ratio (FAR) of 3 within a given plot to identify emerging trends, ranges, and correlations between geometric variables, visual comfort, and energy indicators. Cases are grouped and evaluated in relation to three main urban typologies to highlight unique features related to each typology. The paper also compares two groups of results related to passive and active solar potential, respectively, to identify formal traits that are specific to each of these two design strategies. Finally, the research ranks design options based on total energy use taking into account the energy need for artificial lighting as well as contributions from both passive energy savings and active energy production. Results show that energy demand across cases varies by a factor 2 for passive strategies and a factor 5 when active potential is considered based on shape alone. Best results are clearly positioned at the two extremes of the geometric and proportional range. On the one hand, low-rise compact bar and courtyard buildings that are perhaps most prevalent in our cities today may be effectively retrofitted to meet active energy targets. On the other hand, extremely tall and slim towers appear to be the only typology in the study with the potential to achieve zero-energy status by virtue of their form alone. The work sheds light on the formal implications of EU energy mandates and offers a glimpse of how buildings may adapt to the combined selective pressures of high on-site energy fraction and low energy use to shape our future cities.

AB Urban residential carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased sharply along with the rapid urbanization process. Few studies have considered the different effects of influencing factors between Northern and Southern China, and the analysis of CO2 per unit area from the spatial perspective is also rarely involved. Using the spatial Durbin model (SDM), this study aimed at revealing the influencing factors (including income, inequality, population density, urban morphology, etc.) on CO2 per capita and CO2 per unit area during 2001-2018 between Northern and Southern China. The results showed that the Northern cities had higher carbon emissions and a faster growth rate, and the high-high clusters were also mainly located in the Northern cities. The Gini coefficient was correlated adversely with CO2, while income imposed a positive effect on carbon emissions. The negative coefficients of the quadratic term of the GDP per capita demonstrated that the residential carbon emissions have the potential to decrease when the income increases to a certain level. The indirect effects of income and the Gini showed that spatial spillover effects exist. Urban population density and the ratio of residential area to built-up area had an opposite effect on CO2 per capita and CO2 per unit area, and they have a bigger impact on the CO2 per unit area. This study revealed the different roles of various factors in reducing CO2 per unit area from the spatial perspective and CO2 per capita from the non-spatial perspective between the Northern and Southern regions, which could help policymakers to design targeted mitigation measures in the residential sector in China, providing references for developing countries to jointly reduce carbon emissions to promote the mitigation of global climate change.

AB The energy consumption and its related carbon emission of non-domestic complex buildings in an urban context are complicated due to their wide variety of functions and services. A detailed assessment of the carbon emission of such buildings can contribute to decision making for in-operation building management and schematic designs of future proposals. Concurrently, advances in smart meter data analytics and sensor-enabled operational data streams offer the opportunity to investigate this problem at a finer temporal resolution. This research developed a daily carbon emission benchmarking system of a mixed-use building in a UK university. The research period was set at an annual range from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 and was segmented by strategic periods in line with the operation schedule of the building. The daily benchmark revealed the fluctuation of the building's energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. Based on this, a digital twin framework was developed to identify the possible time periods when the building is less carbon efficient and potential building characters that can lead to increased carbon emission in the operational stage compared with what originally expected at the design stage. We discuss how these insights can offer actionable knowledge for user groups such as asset managers and architects.

AB Due to the increased population in the urbanized areas, considerable attention is being paid on the development of energy-efficient buildings. In construction, the use of insulating foams has grabbed considerable attention in recent decades due to their porous structure that can reduce thermo-acoustic conductivity leading to higher energy efficiency. Nonetheless, the production of certain foams (e.g., polymer foams) is based on harmful chemical substances, such as isocyanate, as well as having difficulty being recycled. In this regard, this study adopted the use of hydrodesulfurization (HDS) spent catalyst, which is a byproduct of petroleum industry and is known to be a hazardous solid waste material, to produce a more environmentally friendly composite foam with lower thermal conductivity. In this sense, a series of material property tests, as well as thermal conductivity test, have been conducted. In addition, to further confirm the impact of HDS inclusion in the produced foams, energy cost savings and CO2 emission reduction based on their actual application in four different environments and four different fuel types for heating have been evaluated. The results are found to be highly promising and point to the great potential of utilizing HDS spent catalyst as a hazardous waste to enhance the efficiency of foams leading to CO2 emission and energy use reduction by up to 68.79 kg/m(2) and 8.6 kWh/m(2), respectively. Finally, this would reduce the heating cost, up to 0.69 $/m(2) in an idealized building. In the end, suggestions for future studies in this area are also provided.

AB A Trombe wall is a passive solar technology attached to the building envelope to reduce energy demands. In warm climates, due to overheating problems in the cooling season, its efficiency is limited and proper operation is required. In this study, the thermal behavior of a bedroom of a house equipped with a Trombe wall in Yazd with a hot and arid climate under different design configurations and various masonry materials were investigated using the dynamic simulation software DesignBuilder. Monthly ventilation strategies and a schedule of blinds for external glass cover throughout the year were proposed to optimize its energy efficiency. The blinds are applied for shading solar irradiance during summer. They also increase the system's thermal resistance during winter nights. According to the results, a concrete Trombe wall with 2/3 of the facade area is capable of reducing the heating load by 86%. However, its function for summertime is negative, and even in the insulation mode, it can increase the cooling load by 5%. Natural ventilation with the Trombe wall is applicable during moderate seasons; however, its cooling efficiency is limited compared to cross ventilation. The results also highlight that retrofitting a room with a Trombe wall can reduce the annual energy demand by 63%, which is equal to a reduction of 124 kg CO2 emission.

AB Urbanization is a powerful symbol and an inevitable human economic and social development trend. This process affects carbon dioxide emissions by changing the human output and lifestyle and encroaches over the carbon sink areas by adjusting the land use types impacting the regional carbon balance. We systematically analyzed the influence of urbanization on regional net CO2 emissions (NCE) and built a quantitative model for the impact of urbanization on NCE based on population, economy, and land use. Based on this, the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) in China has been selected as an example to measure the characteristics of the spatial and temporal evolution of NCE from 2005 to 2018 by empirically testing the contributions of population urbanization, economic urbanization, and land urbanization to the NCE changes in YREB. According to the study's findings, the carbon-neutral pressure index of the YREB increased over the study period, with an increase in NCE from 1706.50 Mt to 3106.05 Mt. The contribution of urbanization in this process increased and subsequently decreased in an inverted U pattern with a drop in the cumulative net emission of 260.32 Mt. The inflection points of the cumulative impact of urbanization on NCE in the midstream and upstream regions occurred in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Due to the high degree of urbanization and economic growth in the downstream area, the urbanization impact demonstrated a constant reduction of NCE over the research period. In terms of sub-dimensions, the population and land urbanization effects were consistently positive, while the economic urbanization affected the NCE and displayed an inverted U pattern during the study period. If the variation in regional carbon sink space is ignored, the impact of urbanization on CO2 emission reduction will be overestimated. We investigated the realization path of differentiated synergistic emission reduction strategies in the great river economic belts based on the empirical study on YREB.

AB The European Commission aims to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the European Union's building stock by 60% by 2030 compared with 1990. Meanwhile, the global demand for cooling is projected to grow 3% yearly between 2020 and 2050. High-temperature cooling systems provide cooling with lower exergy use than conventional cooling systems and enable the integration of renewable energy sources, and can play a crucial role in meeting the growing cooling demand with less energy use. The aim of this study is to analyse and critically evaluate two high-temperature cooling systems in terms of their energy and exergy use in a case study. We also consider thermal comfort performance, CO2 emissions, and sensitivity to changing operating conditions. The two systems considered are a mechanical ventilation system with heat recovery combined with geothermal cooling (GeoMVHR) and a radiant cooling system with ceiling panels connected to the same geothermal cooling (GeoRadiant) system. The study is conducted using building energy models of a typical office building belonging to a three-building school complex located in Sant Cugat near Barcelona, Spain. IDA ICE 4.8 simulation software was used for the simulations. The results show that the two different installations can produce near-identical thermal comfort conditions for the occupants. The GeoRadiant system achieves this result with 72% lower electricity use and 60% less exergy destruction than the GeoMVHR system. Due to the higher electricity use, the CO (2) emissions caused by the GeoMVHR system are 3.5 times the emissions caused by the GeoRadiant system.

ID DEMAND
AB As commercial transportation complexes, expressway service buildings have large passenger flow and a poor energy-saving effect, and have become the focus of energy conservation and emissions reduction efforts in the transportation field. At the same time, the particularity of the function determines that it is within the scope of no municipal supporting facilities, which renders them typical energy island-type buildings. This paper takes the expressway service buildings in a cold area as the research object, and carries out the correlation and partial correlation analysis of the factors influencing the operating energy consumption of the air-conditioning system. For the analysis of factors affecting the energy consumption of expressway service buildings during the operation period, considering that most of the service buildings are in the form of heating and cooling air conditioners, this paper chooses to represent the "refrigeration period" with a more obvious degree of influence. At the same time, during the operation period, because the ontological characteristics have been determined according to the analysis results, the outdoor meteorological characteristics are the main factors affecting the energy consumption of expressway service buildings. These include the dry bulb temperature and horizontal plane solar irradiance index, as well as the indoor comprehensive environment parameters: temperature, CO2 concentration index, indoor personnel density index. Based on the above analysis, a low energy consumption operation strategy for the air-conditioning system is proposed. The results of this article are of great significance for the construction of energy consumption models for expressway service buildings and the adoption of low energy consumption strategies.

AB This paper constructs a model to accurately estimate the urban CO2 emissions in 2000, 2005, and 2013 in China, using the combined data of DMSP/OLS nighttime light data and the provincial energy statistical yearbook data. We calculate and analyze the growth of urban built-up areas and carbon emissions in different time periods both all over the country and the four economic zones in China. It was shown a good fitting relationship between urban growth and carbon emissions, with the R-2 at 0.6188 in 2000, 0.7132 in 2005, and 0.7195 in 2013. The growth rate of developed land area was 13.4% from 2000 to 2005 and 15.9% from 2005 to 2013. During the same period, CO2 emissions had been increasing as well, at an average annual growth rate of 12.2% from 2000 to 2005 and 6.5% from 2005 to 2013. From a spatial point of view, carbon emissions are far greater in the eastern region of China than in western China. The carbon emissions are the highest in major metropolitan cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Per capita carbon emissions are also higher in eastern China, which is consistent with the people's higher living standards. In some cities with large energy and heavy industry concentrations, especially in the northeastern and western regions, the growth rate of carbon emissions has risen faster than in other cities.

AB The energy consumption of buildings accounts for 22% of total global energy use and 13% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the environmental performance of three social housing designs located in emerging economies by analysing sustainability indicators adopting different technical solutions. The analysis incorporates eleven construction strategies to improve the environmental performance of the buildings. The performance assessment is analysed by using EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Methodology. Therefore, this study aims to help identify the construction strategies, with the aim of improving the operational energy performance (kWh/year/m(2)floor), operational CO2 emissions (tCO(2)eq/Year/m(2)floor), embodied energy (MJ/m(2)floor) and operational water consumption of housing (m(3)/year/m(2)floor). The results showed that when the technical measures are implemented, the energy demand decreases by 38.52% in Case A, 19% in Case B, and 41% in Case C. The embodied energy savings in materials in Case A 3%, Case B 0% and Case C 36% Regarding water consumption, the demand decreases by 46%, 4%, and 12% in Case A, B, and C respectively.

AB A novel split type vacuum tube (VT) solar air thermal collection-stepped storage system (ST-VTSATC-SSS) is proposed in this study to address the problem of carbon and pollution emissions from coal-fired heating in rural areas. A VT air collector is used to decrease heat loss. Paraffin and lauric acid are used to conduct thermal stepped storage. The performance of ST-VTSATC-SSS is experimentally investigated. On the coldest day in winter in 2021(T-a = 2.1 degrees C), the collector efficiency is 61.7%, the collection-storage efficiency is 40.7%, and the heat storage is 13.7 MJ. During the thermal collection process, the thermal collection-storage efficiency can be improved by enhancing the air volume flow rate, it decreases with the enhancement of solar radiation, and it can reach 55.3%. During the thermal discharge process, increasing the air volume flow rate can enlarge the discharge power. The average discharge power can reach 904 W. The result reveals that ST-VTSATC-SSS can rapidly release heat. Besides, a heating application for the master bedroom is analyzed. In the heating season, this mechanism can save coal of 373.0 kg and reduce CO2 by 977.3 kg, and the heating cost is 14.6 (Sic)/>GJ. The ST-VTSATC-SSS contributes a new, clean, and low cost heating method in rural building heating. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Windows are among building components that have the strongest effect on thermal load. They play a significant role in heat loss in buildings because they usually have a largely higher thermal conductance than other components of the building envelope. Although many studies have highlighted the relevance of heat transfer through frames and aimed to improve their thermal performance, poorly insulated aluminum frames (thermal conductivity of aluminum is 160 W/m center dot K, while that of polyvinyl chloride [PVC] is 0.17 W/m center dot K) are still in use in Japan. Therefore, the U-values of different window frames were calculated, and annual thermal loads were calculated according to the window configurations, including the frame, glazing, and cavity. We focused on standard residential buildings in Japan with a total floor area of 120.6 m(2) (two-story building), and the number of newly built houses and the application rate of window configurations in 2019 were surveyed to estimate the CO2 emissions by regions. CO2 emissions were reduced by approximately 3.98-6.58% with the application of PVC frames. Furthermore, CO2 emissions were converted into the amount of CO2 gas absorbed by cedar trees, which cover nearly 18% of the total land area of Japan. In conclusion, analogous to the amount of CO2 gas absorbed by cedar trees, the absorption effect was equivalent to 327,743-564,416 cedar trees. Changing the window frame material can facilitate a significant energy-saving effect as a considerable amount of energy is saved, especially at a city scale.

AB Building developers are continuously seeking solutions to increase saleable/rentable floor area and thus the profitability of investments, especially in large/dense cities where the real estate/rental values are high and shortage of available land results in smaller building footprints. Application of passive energy efficiency measures (e.g., thick insulation in walls) not only affects the life cycle sustainability of buildings, but also the floor area and its profitability. This can affect the decisions made on the choice of measures when aiming to improve sustainability. In line with limited studies in this context, a case study is presented here in which multi-objective optimization was used to explore the impact of various passive energy efficiency measures on the life cycle sustainability when accounting for the profitability of the floor area. The building case was a high-rise apartment based on a standardized building concept situated in different locations in Sweden, namely Vindeln, Gothenburg, and Stockholm. The findings indicated that, regardless of the location, use of (1) thick cellulose coating for the roof, and (2) moderately thick expanded polystyrene for the floor, were necessary to improve the life cycle sustainability. However, the optimal wall insulation was dependent on the location; in locations with high real estate values, the scope for using thick and conventional insulations (mineral wool/cellulose) was limited due to the significant economic loss caused by floor area reductions. In general, the optimization identified optimal solutions that could save up to 1410.7 GJ energy, 23 tonnes CO(2)e, and 248.4 TEUR cost from a life cycle perspective relative to the building's initial design.

AB This paper describes a heat pump investigation for GreenSCIES (GS), a fifth Generation district heating and cooling (5DHC) network in Islington, London. The paper describes the GreenSCIES concept integrating Mobility, Power and Heat into a Smart Local Energy System (SLES). At the heart of the system is an ultra-low temperature ambient loop network, which permits bi-directional flow within the pipes to allow energy exchange between heating and cooling customers at different times and in different locations, depending on where demand is at any given time. An existing data centre provides the primary source of waste heat for the scheme. Heat pumps in distributed energy centres are utilised to amplify the temperature of the ambient loop to deliver heat in connected buildings. The energy centres integrate heat pumps with building-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and electric vehicle (EV) charging points. The paper provides an overview of the integrated SLES concept, focussing on the heat pump selection and the short and long-term thermal storage options designed for the scheme. The results show that even the smaller constructible 'New River' scheme will save 5,000 tons of CO(2)e annually. This will tend to 100% as the grid decarbonise further. Therefore, the GS SLES concept applied to urban areas could deliver significant carbon emission savings in the UK and elsewhere. Practical application: Project GreenSCIES, is a detailed design study to develop a Smart, Local Energy System (SLES) for a large community in the London Borough of Islington. Our consortium have developed an innovative SLES concept, centred around a fifth generation district heating and cooling network. The GS ambient loop systems have negligible losses and much greater efficiencies than traditional district heat networks. As recognised by the UK Government's Heat and Buildings Strategy, ambient loop systems should be considered where large-scale neighbourhood regeneration occurs. The proposed SLES concept applied to wider urban areas could deliver significant carbon emission savings in the UK.

   distribution network; Power substitution; Two-stage control scheme
AB Building a robust and capable village power networks plays an important role for responding to national strategic goals of "village revitalization ", "peak carbon dioxide emission " and "carbon neutrality ". At present, user-side distributed photovoltaic (PV) power is encouraged to be implemented in rural areas in China which brings about tremendous pressure to village power grids. Those power grids are already under vulnerable and inferior conditions in reality. Since PV power systems featuring volatility and randomness are commonly implemented in different lines across low-voltage distribution networks (LVDN) in village power networks in Chinese rural area, power imbalance affects the reliability of power supply. There is an urgent need for developing adaptive control strategies for managing this kind of distributed PV systems. This paper firstly studies the topology of a three-phase four-line LVDN with regulated parameters. Afterwards, by analyzing the operational costs of the power grid and equipment reliability, a two-stage control scheme is proposed. Furthermore, the imbalance of three phase power systems, network losses, transformer losses are considered to form a multi objective optimization problem which is solved by tuning transformer voltage, reactive power from PV inverters, energy storage system and demand response schemes. An actual LVDN and associated parameters from a real power distribution networks in Bijie region in Guizhou province, China are used in this study. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested where 32.1% of power loss is reduced with three-phase imbalance being obviously mitigated accordingly. (C)& nbsp;2022 The Author(s).

AB Designing waterfront redevelopment generally focuses on attractiveness, leisure, and beauty, resulting in various types of building and block shapes with limited considerations on environmental aspects. However, increasing climate change impacts necessitate these buildings to be sustainable, resilient, and zero CO2 emissions. By producing five scenarios (plus existing buildings) with constant floor areas, we investigated how buildings and district forms with building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) affect energy consumption and production, self-sufficiency, CO2 emission, and energy costs in the context of waterfront redevelopment in Tokyo. From estimated hourly electricity demands of the buildings, techno-economic analyses were conducted for rooftop PV systems for 2018 and 2030 with declining costs of rooftop PV systems. We found that environmental building designs with rooftop PV system are increasingly economical in Tokyo with CO2 emission reduction of 2-9% that depends on rooftop sizes. Payback periods drop from 14 years in 2018 to 6 years in 2030. Toward net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, immediate actions are necessary to install rooftop PVs on existing and new buildings with energy efficiency improvements by construction industry and building owners. To facilitate such actions, national and local governments need to adopt appropriate policies.

AB Electric cars are becoming increasingly popular in Poland and around the world. More and more of them appear on the roads, especially in the centers of large cities. They are perceived and advertised as zero-emission cars, not polluting the environment. However, electric cars, such as cars with combustion engines, need to be "refueled", so they are charged from the power grid. It is important to say that it depends on what the source of energy is. Unfortunately, in the case of Poland, most of the energy in this network (about 80%) comes from sources using fossil fuels (lignite, hard coal, and natural gas). These are not environmentally friendly energy sources. Despite the use of multi-stage exhaust gas cleaning, toxic compounds and carbon dioxide get into the atmosphere. The situation is stalemate because the more energy is needed to power industry, households and electric cars, the more carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. This paper will demonstrate that the use of the term "green vehicle" in reference to electric automotive vehicles may be a misuse of the term, because if the local conditions of toxic emissions binding for vehicles with combustion engines had been taken into account during type-approval tests of such vehicles, electric vehicles would never have been put into service, not only in towns but everywhere else, too. Calculations show that carbon dioxide (201.2 g), nitrogen oxides (0.166 g), and particulate matters (0.0095 g) emitted by electropower plants are almost twice as large per 100 km than emitted by diesel engine. The solution to this situation is only an increased investment in the power industry based on renewable energy sources (RES). Currently, photovoltaic and wind power plants are experiencing rapid development in Poland, but they produce energy in an unpredictable way, and moreover, they need huge areas to build high-power installations. Much more stable sources of energy are hydroelectric power plants, which are in serious regression in Poland. Planned investments are constantly postponed. Yet, even in the lower Vistula cascade, already planned in the middle of the last century, there is a potential which, if used, would make it possible to ensure clean energy for powering electric vehicles for several dozen years to come. The authors wanted to pay attention to the need to introduce sustainable diversification of energy sources which, following the increase of investment in hydropower, would make it possible to plan the development of electromobility in Poland in a more secure way. The launch of the Lower Vistula cascade would eventually enable the zero-emission operation of approximately 1.5 million electric vehicles.

TI A qualitative assessment of the impact of smart homes and

DE Smart home; Smart home technology; Smart grid
AB Purpose There are 29 million homes in the UK, accounting for 14% of the UK's energy consumption. This is given that UK has one of the highest water and energy demands in Europe which needs to be addressed according to the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). Smart homes technology holds a current perception that it is principally used by "tech-savvy" users with larger budgets. However, smart home technology can be used to control water, heat and energy in the entire house. This paper investigates how smart home technology could be effectively utilised to aid the UK government in meeting climate change targets and to mitigate the environmental impact of a home in use towards reducing carbon emissions. Design/methodology/approach Both primary and secondary data were sought to gain insight into the research problem. An epistemological approach to this research is to use interpretivism to analyse data gathered via a semi-structured survey. Two groups of participants were approached: (1) professionals who are deemed knowledgeable about smart home development and implementation and (2) users of smart home technology. A variety of open-ended questions were formulated, allowing participants to elaborate by exploring issues and providing detailed qualitative responses based on their experience in this area which were interpreted quantitatively for clearer analysis. Findings With fossil fuel reserves depleting, there is an urgency for renewable, low carbon energy sources to reduce the 5 tonnes annual carbon emissions from a UK household. This requires a multi-faceted and a multimethod approach, relying on the involvement of both the general public and the government in order to be effective. By advancing energy grids to make them more efficient and reliable, concomitant necessitates a drastic change in the way of life and philosophy of homeowners when contemplating a reduction of carbon emissions. If both parties are able to do so, the UK is more likely to reach its 2050 net-zero carbon goal. The presence of a smart meter within the household is equally pivotal. It has a positive effect of reducing the amount of carbon emissions and hence more need to be installed. Research limitations/implications Further research is needed using a larger study sample to achieve more accurate and acceptable generalisations about any future course of action. Further investigation on the specifics of smart technology within the UK household is also needed to reduce the energy consumption in order to meet net-zero carbon 2050 targets due to failures of legislation. Practical implications For smart homes manufacturers and suppliers, more emphasis should be placed to enhance compatibility and interoperability of appliances and devices using different platform and creating more user's friendly manuals supported by step-by-step visual to support homeowners in the light of the wealth of knowledge base generated over the past few years. For homeowners, more emphasis should be placed on creating online knowledge management platform easily accessible which provide virtual support and technical advice to home owners to deal with any operational and technical issues or IT glitches. Developing technical design online platform for built environment professionals on incorporating smart sensors and environmentally beneficial technology during early design and construction stages towards achieving low to zero carbon homes.
   Originality/value This paper bridges a significant gap in the body of knowledge in term of its scope, theoretical validity and practical applicability, highlighting the impact of using smart home technology on the environment. It provides an insight into how the UK government could utilise smart home technology in order to reduce its carbon emission by identifying the potential link between using smart home technology and environmental sustainability in tackling and mitigating climate change. The findings can be applied to other building types and has the potential to employ aspects of smart home technology in order to manage energy and water usage including but not limited to healthcare, commercial and industrial buildings.

AB A generation-to-load simulation estimated the impact, in terms of production costs and CO2 emissions, attributable to the joint optimization of electric power generation and flexible end uses to support increasing penetrations of renewable energy. Newly conceived, evaluated, and foundational in developing a U.S. National Standard was a transaction-less yet continuous demand response system based on a day-ahead optimum load shape (OLS) designed to encourage Internet-connected devices to autonomously and voluntarily explore options to favour lowest cost generators - without requiring two-way communications, personally identifiable information, or customer opt-in. Boundary conditions used for model calibration included historical weather, residential building stock construction attributes, home appliance and device empirical operating schedules, prototypical power distribution feeder models, thermal generator heat rates, startup and ramping constraints, and fuel costs. Results of an hourly-based annual case study of Texas indicate a 1/3 reduction in production costs and a 1/5 reduction in CO2 emissions are possible.

AB From the 1970s to the 1990s, over 3.5 billion square meters of residential building areas were completed in China to accommodate the increased population in cities. Most of the constructed buildings were built without insulation and proper ventilation. Currently, these buildings are reaching the end of their designed service lifetime. Therefore, retrofitting and rebuilding represent two different options to upgrade or completely replace these old buildings. However, material utilization levels of retrofitting and the rebuilding plans are completely different, resulting in different embodied energy consumption and operation energy consumption levels. This study examines the old residential buildings located in the cold climate zone of China. The study found that rebuilding these old residential buildings normally attain higher embodied energy consumption and embodied CO2 emissions due to high material input. Therefore, rebuilding plans might not be the highest priority, and government managers should consider the environmental impacts from the embodied energy consumption when formulating decisions regarding the future of these old residential buildings. Additionally, the insulation thickness is an important parameter for the main building fabrics of retrofitted and rebuilt buildings to reduce heating and cooling energy demand. Although, this study has identified that the rebuilt buildings cause higher CO2 emissions than retrofitted buildings. However, various parameters, such as thematerials' embodied coefficient, the carbon intensity of the operation energy sources and ratios of the surface areas of the glazing windows to the external walls, should be considered by decision-makers.

ID POLICY; SHENZHEN; CHINA; WATER
AB To achieve the Paris Agreement's goals, many cities are building satellite cities to relieve the population and environment pressure of the central city. However, past experiences showed that long-term effects of such a solution were partially limited, due to limited attention on the effects of energy consumption and carbon emissions, depending on the dynamics of population and industrial development. This paper overcomes the previous limitations, applying a Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning model to the area of Xiong'an New District, an area extending from Hebei province (China) and nearby Beijing, is planned to support the development of Beijing. The proposed model was based on three different population migration, industrial and transposition scenarios to test their impacts on urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Results show that: (1) Increased population and building area will markedly increase GHG emissions from residential consumption in Hebei province, while slightly decrease GHG emissions in Beijing. (2) Green planning, including industrial structure changes, industrial transformation, will markedly decrease the GHG emissions in Hebei provinces and it can take down for the emissions increase due to the population migration. This paper proved the effectiveness of a multi-scalar, multi-dimensional, and multi-actor modeling approach for a satellite city and new town development planning, implying that a similar approach could be applied in planning and managing the development of future satellite cities.

AB There has been a good deal of discussion over the most sustainable model for development of housing in India. Planners discuss the advantages of low-rise versus high-rise development in terms of energy and cost efficiency. Shortage and high cost of land has been a justification for high-rise development. In this paper, mixed housing (EWS, LIG, MIG, and HIG), from 1 to 30 stories, has been analyzed at a city level for a fixed population for embodied energy, construction cost, and potential for CO2e sequestration. The inference drawn from this exercise is that low-rise (1-4 stories) load-bearing development is energy and cost efficient and can accommodate the maximum number of housing units in about 4% of the land area in a city. High-rise development is 194% and 17.5% more than low-rise in terms of embodied energy and construction cost, respectively. It is also found that 100% of CO2e can be sequestered by planting trees in available open areas in low-rise developments compared with 57% in high-rise development (30-story). Further, high-rise development results in only marginal increase in open areas after four stories. Hence, high-rise development is neither sustainable nor cost effective.

AB The integration of closed biomass cycles into residential buildings enables efficient resource utilization and avoids the transport of biowaste. In our scenario called Integrated Cycles for Urban Biomass (ICU), biowaste is degraded on-site into biogas that is converted into heat and electricity. Nitrification processes upgrade the liquid fermentation residues to refined fertilizer, which can be used subsequently in house-internal gardens to produce fresh food for residents. Our research aims to assess the ICU scenario regarding produced amounts of biogas and food, saved CO2 emissions and costs, and social-cultural aspects. Therefore, a model-based feasibility study was performed assuming a building with 100 residents. The calculations show that the ICU concept produces 21% of the annual power (electrical and heat) consumption from the accumulated biowaste and up to 7.6 t of the fresh mass of lettuce per year in a 70 m(2) professional hydroponic production area. Furthermore, it saves 6468 kg CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) per year. While the ICU concept is technically feasible, it becomes economically feasible for large-scale implementations and higher food prices. Overall, this study demonstrates that the ICU implementation can be a worthwhile contribution towards a sustainable CO2-neutral society and decrease the demand for agricultural land.

AB More than half of the world's population lives in cities. A large part of the emissions and energy consumption corresponds to buildings, both in the residential sector and in the service sector. This means that a large part of the measures taken by governments to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are focused on this sector. With this background, this paper studies energy consumption in city buildings and the CO2 emissions they produce. It only makes use of publicly available data. The analysis is made from the point of view of income per inhabitant, and the results are obtained per inhabitant and household. To facilitate the analysis of the results, an index has been defined. The main contributions of this work are to analyze energy consumption and emissions due to buildings, study them from the point of view of the income of their inhabitants, and consider cities individually. The proposed methodology has been applied to the case of Spain. A total of 145 Spanish cities that have more than 50,000 inhabitants have been studied. The results show that the higher the income, the higher the consumption and emissions. Electricity consumptions are almost inelastic, while those of thermal origin are greatly influenced by the level of income. Regarding CO2 emissions, the percentage of emissions of electrical origin with respect to total emissions is higher than that of thermal origin. In addition, the lower the income, the higher the percentage of emissions of electrical origin.

AB Half of the world's population lives in cities. In addition, more than 40% of greenhouse gas emissions are produced in buildings in the residential and tertiary sectors. Therefore, cities, and in particular their buildings, have a great influence on these emissions. In fact, they are reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Any measure taken to reach these goals has a significant impact from the point of view of reducing greenhouse gases. An understanding of these goals is the basis of greenhouse gas mitigation. This work analyzed the CO2 emissions from the buildings in cities as a function of the economic income of their inhabitants. For this, databases published by official sources were used. The origins of the CO2 are usually emitted by buildings were analyzed-electrical and thermal, in the form of natural gas. Another variable that influences these emissions is climate. To study only the income variable, the influence of climate has been eliminated. Also, to facilitate analysis, an index has been introduced. As an example of application of the proposed methodology, Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants were studied. The analysis was carried out by household and by inhabitant. The results showed the following: the higher the income of the citizens, the higher the total and thermal emissions; thermal consumption is elastic, while electrical consumption is inelastic; emissions of electrical origin are almost constant; emissions from electrical energy are greater than those from thermal energy; as income increases, the ratio between emissions of electrical and thermal origin decreases.

AB Heat pumps are currently being developed to reduce the energy footprint for residential and commercial building space conditioning and water heating loads in cold climates. To mitigate the nocuous impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and to create a carbon-neutral building stock, alternate lower-GWP refrigerants must also replace the predominant use of R-410A, without re-engineering the mechanical hardware. In this paper, we analyze the performance of lower-GWP alternative refrigerants (R-32, R-452B, R-454B, and R-466A) relative to the conventional R-410A and draw conclusions on the relative performances to meet cooling loads. The simulations are accomplished using the heat pump design model, a well-known, public-domain design tool with a free web interface and downloadable desktop version to support public use and the HVAC R&D community. The contributions contain detailed, hardware-based heat exchanger and system analyses to provide a comprehensive assessment. The results of the simulation are scrutinized from the first (capacity and energy efficiency) and second laws (exergy analysis) to identify sources of systemic inefficiency, the root cause of lost work. This rigorous approach provides an exhaustive analysis of alternate lower-GWP refrigerants to replace R-410A using the same hardware. The results have practical value in engineering heat pumps in an economy that is compelled to alter by the consequences and uncertainties of climate change, to reduce its anthropogenic carbon footprint.

AB This article introduces BioZero, a nature-inspired near-zero building proposed for Quay St, Brooklyn, New York. The building is designed for the maximum use of daylight and natural ventilation. This is the result of its shallow plan depth and the inner light wells/ventilation stacks, which also serve the inner circulation space. The light wells/ventilation stacks are created as a result of the organic shape of the internal partitions. The building is constructed from a steel frame and hemp-lime bio-composite material (hempcrete), which smooths out the fluctuations of internal air temperature and relative humidity. The south facing facade is fitted with the Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) photovoltaic array that covers 90% of the opaque surface area of the facade. The design was based on nature-inspired computation, with sustainability principles as guiding constraints. The main findings are that the building achieves -227 tonnes of negative embodied carbon due to sequestration of CO2 in the hemp plant from which the material was harvested, and a net-zero operation. The main conclusions are that in the context of climate emergency, nature inspired design leads to energy efficient buildings with a high level of thermal comfort, which are buildable and sustainable.

AB A heating transition is urgently needed to fulfil the national CO2 reduction targets in Germany. Thus, in 2019, there has been a strong policy push towards increasing the share of renewables in heating through the introduction of the Climate Action Programme 2030 and the reform of existing policies. In addition to the policy landscape on the national level, federal states have further leeway to implement policies; these options are currently largely unresearched. In order to fill this gap, we developed a System Dynamics Model for Lower Saxony to determine the effect of recent policy changes as well as additional regional subsidy schemes on the heating market. The results show that even though changes in subsidies can increase the renewable uptake considerably, the CO2e and energy demand reduction targets are not met in any of the examined scenarios. Furthermore, the model shows that policy formulation must take the inertia of the sector into account and completely turn away from fossil fuels to reach the stipulated emission reductions.

AB Contemporary research stresses the need to reduce mankind's environmental impacts and achieve sustainability. One of the keys to this is the construction sector. New buildings have to comply with strict limits regarding resource consumption (energy, water use, etc.). However, they make up only a fraction of the existing building stock. Renovations of existing buildings are therefore essential for the reduction of the environmental impacts in the construction sector. This paper illustrates the situation using a case study of a rural terraced house in a village near Brno, Czech Republic. It compares the life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the original house and its proposed renovation as well as demolition followed by new construction. The LCA covers both the initial embodied environmental impacts (EEIs) and the 60-year operation of the house with several variants of energy sources. The results show that the proposed renovation would reduce overall environmental impacts (OEIs) of the house by up to 90% and the demolition and new construction by up to 93% depending on the selected energy sources. As such, the results confirm the importance of renovations and the installation of environmentally-friendly energy sources for achieving sustainability in the construction sector. They also show the desirability of the replacement of inefficient old buildings by new construction in specific cases.

AB The METAPOLIS as the polycentric network of urban-rural settlement is undergoing constant transformation and urbanization processes. In particular, the associated imbalance of the shrinkage and growth of different settlement types in relative geographical proximity causes negative effects, such as urban sprawl and the divergence of urban-rural lifestyles with their related resource, land and energy consumption. Implicitly related to these developments, national and global sustainable development goals for the building sector lead to the question of how a region can be assessed without detailed research and surveys to identify critical areas with high potential for sustainable development. In this study, the TOPOI method is used. It classifies settlement units and their interconnections along the urban-rural gradient, in order to quantify and assess the land-uptake and global warming potential driven by residential developments. Applying standard planning parameters in combination with key data from a comprehensive life cycle assessment of the residential building stock, a detailed understanding of different settlement types and their associated resource and energy consumption is achieved.

DE Decentralized Photovoltaics PV to meet the residential energy demand;

   potential on residential envelopes; PV for high-rise apartments in urban
   areas
AB On-site deployment of renewable energy capacities for buildings in the cities is a prerequisite for most of the building energy codes in India. As residential energy consumption increases at a rapid rate due to intensive electrification and increased affordability, it is appropriate to generate it on-site to decongest the grid. Solar PV is viewed as a clean option in India with average peak sunshine of 4-6 kWh/day (1kWh = 3.6 MJ). In urban areas, the envelopes of dense residential towers for both rooftop and facade are seen as viable options to generate electricity. This research explores the solar potential of residential envelopes to meet energy demand. Solar energy potential of residential envelopes was mapped on the roofs and facades through color solar insolation mapping in DIVA-for-Rhino, and the amount of solar PV energy that could be generated was calculated. This amount was matched with the energy demand of residential blocks obtained from a survey conducted by a published source. By investigating the techno-commercial potential of residential blocks in representative cities in each of India's four climate zones, it was found that rooftop photovoltaics RTPV would contribute up to 65-100% of common facilities (lifts and lights) consumption for Ground+20 floors. Facade offset was above 100% for all the cities for south- and west-facing facades for Ground+20 floors for common facilities. The payback period for common services' energy consumption was economically attractive with around 6-7 years for rooftop and facade PV, as they have higher electricity tariffs than the individual household consumption tariff rate. The novelty of this research was in identifying the facade PV potential for multistory residential buildings for each of India's climates. The study's findings illustrate that rooftop and building integrated photovoltaics enable residential buildings to move toward self-reliance with respect to their energy needs, thereby contributing to decreased carbon emissions. Green building consultants, developers, and consumers will view this research as a viable means to reduce carbon footprints of residential buildings.

AB The lifetime and complexity of some IT scenarios significantly exceed the typical lifetime and complexity of a technological system. This is a source of significant economic efficiency improvement. In this paper, we propose an approach that enables us to leverage costs, reduce the space floor requirements, and lower CO2 emissions incurred by the infrastructure. By re-investing a significantly smaller financial amount compared to the initial investment an IT infrastructure with the same or better performance and with significantly higher energy efficiency can be purchased. By using a mathematical model, we can quantify the benefits of the approach based on technological advancement, electrical energy prices, and prices of data centre construction. We compare two strategies: the frozen strategy relying on a fixed IT infrastructure during the entire IT system lifecycle and the migration strategy leveraging technological advancement.

AB This paper analyzes different options to meet CO2 emission targets in the Bahamas while satisfying sustainability and conservation of natural attractions of the country. The current targets by 2027 are 55% of total electricity generating capacity by mostly wind and to a more limited extent solar photovoltaic, an even larger than 55% reduction of the electricity generating capacity by combustion fuels, and a 33% reduction in electricity con-sumption. No mention is made of the battery energy storage to make the grid stable, more efficient, and cleaner use of combustion fuels, the pollution from transport, and the management of waste and biomass. The resource is modest for wind, and better for solar photovoltaic. The area is prone to hurricanes that may damage the wind energy installations. Additionally, wind requires the interconnection of the 16 island grids. It is demonstrated here that better CO2 reduction can be achieved by building electricity generating capacity of solar photovoltaic only, leaving the capacity of hydrocarbon fuel facilities upgraded for cleaner production, switching to electric transport, and valorizing biomass and waste. This makes unnecessary wind energy developments, which will also impact adversely the landscape and the environment, being noxious to humans and wildlife, disturbing natural scenery, and touristic attraction.

AB In Taiwan, the daytime temperature usually exceeds 37 degrees C in summer, and the increase in air-conditioning usage has led to higher energy demand, which brings a heavy burden to power plants. The Kaohsiung House Project, undertaken by the city government, encourages the installation of greening facilities in buildings, such as photovoltaic (PV) panels on rooftops and vertical gardens on balconies, in order to preserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. In the present study, the urban heat island effect and temperature distribution within the city was examined through the establishment of 16 temperature measurement sites within a 7.5 km x 6 km area. A between-site temperature difference of 2 degrees C was observed between April and August. Areas with higher temperature are recommended to increase their green space ratio through the project. Moreover, relocating PV panels in low-temperature areas increased the overall generation efficiency by 0.8%. Through the analysis of the measured data, this study determined which areas were more appropriate for green space expansion, and which would best serve for green energy generation, all with the aim of improving external environmental comfort and maximizing carbon reduction. Recommendations regarding the implementation of subsequent policies were issued and they provide reference for implementation in other cities.

AB The ever-increasing concentration of Carbon footprint into the environment has drastically changed the climatic conditions. Among many anthropogenic activities, the housing sector remains one of the major contributors. However, a complete assessment of these environmental impacts throughout the life cycle still remains an area of concern. Most of the study does not assess the impacts by each phase of lifecycle. The current work presents a complete approach for carbon footprint assessment including planning, construction, operational, maintenance and dismantling & dispose-off phase. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with boundary limitations of 'cradle to grave' was adopted. Thirteen housing units were selected as case study. These included detached, semi-detached and terraced types of construction. Selected units were developed in a virtual environment using Building Information Modeling (BIM). The study observed the average contribution range from 1.48 tons-CO2/yr to 2.85 tons-CO2/yr. On individual basis, the execution phase dominated the five phases with almost 43 %. The operational phase shared 39 % followed by maintenance (15 %), dismantling & dispose-off (1.8 %) and planning at the last (1.5 %). The categorization of environmental impact into embodied and operational carbon footprint observed the embodied part in dominance. A strong positive relationship between the area of housing units and resulting carbon impact was also observed. The work presents one of few environmental studies for a tropical housing sector assessing complete life cycle. The study provides a vital guideline to the designers for ensuring a sustainable environment by assessing and opting less carbon intensive options at early stage of planning and design.

AB Recently the EU established the new obligations of the member states towards 2030, which are the reduction of CO2 emissions in 40% with regards to the values in 1990, the integration of 32% of renewable energy production, the improvement of energy efficiency in 32.5% and the establishment of 15% of electric interconnection among member states. Beyond 2030, the EU establishes also as global target the decarbonisation of the economy by 2050. While for new buildings the principles to achieve nearly zero or very efficient buildings are well established and technically and economically viable, these principles are less clear in large scale renovations of existing buildings. It is precisely in renovation where the focus should be to reach climate neutrality in the coming 30 years due to the high amount of existing building stock in Europe and the potential that consequently these urban areas offer. The strategies to achieve nearly zero retrofitted buildings have to balance technical solutions, economic viability and integration of renewable sources. Also, the issue of scale becomes essential, where districts can be considered as a system of complex interconnections, interactions, relationships and flows that offer greater flexibility to integrate certain Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) or to implement specific business models. Therefore a comprehensive approach is essential for effective decision-making with regards to energy efficiency improvement. Thus, approaches for a comprehensive and integrated renovation of districts are needed to unlock the full potential existing on retrofitting the building stock. This paper builds on this element and presents the energy retrofitting of a residential neighborhood in Spain under the EU funded project REMOURBAN that has followed an integrated approach to design the appropriate combination of ECMs leading to 40% of energy consumption reduction and 85% of CO2 emissions avoided to the atmosphere.

AB The main source of building energy consumption in Iran is fossil fuels. The building sector, as a result, is responsible for a high share of CO(2)emissions in this country. To address the issue, the government has recently adopted the "green management system" policy in order to alleviate the severe rate of CO(2)emissions from the government buildings. As a commitment to the policy, the University of Tehran plans to transform into the first green university of Iran through green retrofitting in the coming years. As the first step to the retrofitting process, this paper measures the potential of energy-saving and CO(2)emission reduction in the University of Tehran Science & Technology Park (UTSTP) offices with the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM). For this, Building No. 2 of UTSTP is modeled in the environment of DesignBuilder software to provide a calibrated computational model for energy and carbon audit. A detailed audit is then conducted using the calibrated model to identify the major areas of energy loss in the case study. Based on the audit results, several green strategies are then proposed to improve the weak performance of building in the identified areas. The strategies include triple glazing windows, aerogel envelope, phase change material (PCM) insulation, and Trombe wall. Findings suggest that the thermal loss from the building structure as a result of insufficient levels of insulation in the building components is the main source of energy loss in the building. Simulation results show that green strategies to a large extent have good energy-saving and mitigation potential. Full implementation of the proposed green strategies would reduce the annual heating needs and CO(2)emissions of the case study by 51.6% and 5.39% respectively.

AB In this paper, we present a new approach for the analysis of the dependence of construction costs on the geometric shape of a building. Instead of difficult or even impossible-to-establish uniform prices and costs, we propose a cost analysis concerning the amount of materials needed for construction. We show that the basic parameters are the base area of the building (plan), assumed in the study as the building area, and the area of the external walls of the building. The amount of consumption of most materials is proportional to the base area and the area of the external walls. The materials required for construction consume large amounts of energy during their manufacture. Therefore, shape optimization is not only economically significant for the investor but is also important in terms of the energy consumption, i.e., embodied energy. We propose a set of indicators to help a designer optimize the shape of the building at the initial design stage.

AB Purpose The central motivation for this study was to examine alternatives against the apartment area reduction as a safe way to reduce construction costs, adopted by many construction companies. From the building economic compactness index concept, it was studied the cost and environmental impacts (material consumption, embodied energy - EE and CO(2)emission). Design/methodology/approach The research strategy takes advantage of a case study aiming to investigate the relation between design characteristics related to area (m(2)) and building economic compactness index (%) with cost (Research Stage 1) and with environmental impacts: (Research Stage 2). The study involved real data from social housing projects, chosen in terms in terms of very similar features like size, area and constructive method (constants), however, with dissimilar compactness (variable). Findings The lack of direct relation between area and cost signs the importance of including the cost of vertical plans considered in the economic compactness building. The higher the economic compactness index, the lower the cost, the lower the amount of material, EE and CO(2)emission parameters. However, due to the wide range of EE and CO(2)values available, the reduction in the amount of materials achieved by increasing building economic compactness index may not be reflected in EE and CO(2)gains. Research limitations/implications As the limitation of this study, it must be taken into account a limited number of case buildings and the fact that the analysis is dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the data provided by constructors and the available information of EE and CO(2)emission. As well discussed in the literature, the consistent database is a great challenge for the construction sector. Originality/value There might be alternatives to higher areas with relatively low-cost increments since results from buildings with the same area present different cost estimative and suggest a strong relationship with the economic compactness index. The large variation of EE and CO(2)emission data indicates that reductions obtained by compactness increase may be impaired if the construction materials are produced with high levels of EE and CO(2)emission. Thus, there must be an integrated effort on the part of designers (design and material specification) and manufacturers (material production), since isolated solutions may not be enough.

AB Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become a versatile tool to analyze the building life cycle and to achieve efficient use of natural resources and raw materials, as well as waste reduction, reuse and recycling towards the goal of a decarbonized building stock for 2020 in Europe. This work proposes a new methodology to introduce embodied energy (EE), carbon emissions (CE), construction & demolition waste (CDW), and urban solid waste (USW) indicators into BIM models to assess environmental impact following the work breakdown structure of the Andalusian Construction Cost Database (ACCD). A case study of a social residential block is presented, focused on the concrete structure analysis because of its high impact. The results show the preponderant role that concrete plays in the environmental impact. It is also observed that steel consumes less energy than concrete and provokes less CE as well. Moreover, it offers the possibility of recycling while reducing waste quantity. When analyzed by task, foundations present much less impact than the superstructure. Furthermore, each square meter of the typical housing block generates 76.11kg of CDW, being 75.77 kg of mixed waste, mainly concrete and 0.34 kg of steel waste.

   Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)
AB Buildings currently consume 36% of the world's energy and contribute nearly 40% of CO2 emissions. Many countries desire to generate virtual models of their nation's buildings in order to coordinate research activities and inform market opportunities for a more sustainable built environment. The United States Department of Energy uses a suite of Commercial Prototype Building Models, which currently includes 16 building types and covers 80% of US commercial floorspace. Efforts are underway to expand this suite by developing prototype models for additional building types. In this paper, we outline a systematic approach to defining the building, collecting relevant information and creating a flexible model while doing so in the pragmatic context of a courthouse building. Informed by building design guides, databases, documented projects and inputs from courthouse design experts, we define a small, 69,324 ft(2) (6440 m(2)), four-courtroom, low-rise courthouse as the prototype to represent an average-size courthouse in the US. We present building characteristics relevant for energy model development and provide the rationale for their selection. These details combined with climate- and construction-vintage-specific requirements for the building envelope and systems from building standards will be used for developing the courthouse model for the Commercial Prototype Building Models suite. The comprehensive information presented will also guide model modification to capture the dynamics of smaller or larger courthouses more accurately for building or system size-specific research.

AB Land-use change, particularly urban expansion, can greatly affect the carbon balance, both from the aspects of terrestrial ecosystems and anthropogenic carbon emissions. Coastal China is a typical region of rapid urban expansion, and obvious spatial heterogeneity exists from the north to south. However, the different urban change characteristics and the effect on carbon balance remain undetermined. By unifying the spatial-temporal resolution of carbon source and sink data, we effectively compared the carbon budgets of three coastal urban agglomerations in China. The results show that all of the three urban agglomerations have undergone an obvious urban expansion process, with the built-up area increasing from 1.03 x 10(4) km(2) in 2000 to 3.06 x 10(4) km(2) in 2013. For Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the built-up area gradually expanded. The built-up area in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) gradually changed before 2007 but rapidly grew thereafter. The built-up expansion of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) passed through three growing stages and showed the largest mean patch size. Carbon emission spatial patterns in the three urban agglomerations are consistent with their economic development, from which the net ecosystem production (NEP) spatial patterns are very different. Compared to carbon emissions, NEP has a carbon sink effect and can absorb some carbon emissions, but the amounts were all much lower than the carbon emissions in the three urban agglomerations. The carbon sink effect in the Yangtze River Delta is the most obvious, with the Pearl River Delta following, and the lowest effect is in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Finally, a scientific basis for policy-making is provided for viable CO2 emission mitigation policies.

AB Constructing structural elements requires high performance materials. Important decisions about geometry and materials are made during the design and execution phases. This study analyzes and evaluates the relevant factors for reinforced concrete columns made in situ for residential buildings. This article identifies and highlights the most sensitive aspects in column design: geometry, type of cement, and concrete strength performance. Using C-40 concrete mixed with CEM-II proved to cut costs (up to 17.83%) and emissions (up to 13.59%). The ideal combination of rebar and concrete is between 1.47 and 1.73: this is the percentage of the ratio between the area of rebar and the area of the concrete section. The means used during the execution phase affect resource optimization. The location of a building has only a minor impact, wherein the wind zone exercises more influence than topographic altitude.

AB The energy consumption of Spanish housing stock has to be analysed to promote appropriate urban refurbishment policies, and to reduce CO2 emissions. As building typologies differ considerably from one area to another, prior territory differentiation is required. In this regard, this study develops a methodology to analyse the residential building stock from Extremadura, and investigates a group of dwellings from different periods and building types. In the study, energy simulations, surveys and invoice data have been used, and both demand and consumption indicators have been provided. Therefore, the obtained values demonstrate that single-family houses consume, on average, between 100 and 200 kWh/m2, while multi-family houses reduce their values between 6o and150 kWh/m2, being the highest values those that belong to the constructive period between 1940 and 1980. In addition it is observed that most of the houses in the sample suffer energy poverty.

AB The current trend of global warming is causing an increase of worldwide air-conditioning installations with associated growth of electricity consumption and related CO2 emissions. The application of passive cooling systems (PCSs) could represent an alternative solution, hence contributing to the reduction of global warming as set by the agreement reached amid 195 countries at the COP21 Conference. Among the several PCSs, a contemporary version of the Iranian wind tower is considered in this paper through its application in temperate-hot climate zones. Palermo, Italy, was chosen as a reference site, since its climate characteristics are similar to the ones of the Middle East areas where wind towers originated. A wind tower functions by catching wind from a higher altitude and directing it into the adjacent building with the aim of providing cooling and/or ventilation effect. The original wind tower had one or more openings facing all favourable wind directions. A model comprising a one-channel wind tower and a room attached to it was analysed. Its performance was assessed using a simulation software calculating the potential cooling energy reduction due to controlled natural ventilation. The effects of orientation, height, size and direction of inlet and outlet apertures were simulated and relevant results presented.

AB Turkey's diverse regions lead to complex issues in sustainability. We studied to cities in different areas of the country to examine the effects of local climate on energy use in energy-efficient buildings. Erzurum is the coldest city; Antalya lies in the Mediterranean region and has the highest solar global horizontal radiation in Turkey. We used Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) values for both cities to estimate the energy demand for heating and cooling the buildings. In Erzurum, CO2 emissions are high, because fuel consumption to heat the same building is more than 4 times of that of Antalya in winter. CO2 emission is significant as the key greenhouse gas. In Antalya, the electricity costs for cooling the same building are more than 42 times that of Erzurum; CO2 emissions are also higher during summer. A building certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) uses about 35% less energy for heating and cooling in both cities. The economic and environmental contributions of a LEED-certified building in Erzurum is higher during cold weather, while in Antalya, a LEED-certified building conserves comparatively more energy and retains more CO2 during hot weather. The results show that the LEED Certification System can be a more international system if geographical and climatic differences are also taken into consideration.

AB Rapid economic development induces energy shortage and environmental pollution, and the utilization of renewable energy becomes a hot topic. Taking the tidal energy in Shanghai as a research object, this article analyzes the reserves, potential developing mode, and potential capacity on the basis of observation data for 18 years. The results show that the tidal energy resources are abundant in Shanghai's sea area of China. Through tidal range analysis and tidal energy reserves calculation, the tidal barrage can be built to explore the tidal energy from the water head difference between the flood tide and the ebb in the north branch of Yangtze River Estuary, while the tidal turbines can be built to generate electricity in the Northern Hangzhou Bay. The tidal energy reserve is 3.65 million kW per year in Shanghai's sea area of China. The annual electricity generating capacity is 10.07 billion kWh, which is equivalent to 3.63 million tons of standard coal, accounting for 3.72% of Shanghai energy consumption in 2007. It can also reduce 9.50 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, 30.8 thousand tons of sulfur dioxide emissions, and 26.8 thousand tons of nitrogen oxides emissions. The utilization of tidal energy is an effective method to solve environmental problems and energy issues.

   mainly located? Two different virtual perspectives on the LCA analysis
   of the construction methods and components of four different apartment
   buildings
SO BAUINGENIEUR
LA German
DT Article
AB A set of four buildings, consisting of different types of construction, is being analysed in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The aim of this study is to address one essential challenge in LCAs of buildings, namely the presentation of the LCA results in a way that clearly provides valuable information for the architect, with regard to which building elements are the main contributors to the overall embodied carbon emissions of a building over its entire lifetime. The results are presented by virtually "cutting" the buildings in two different ways, focusing not only on the building as a whole, incorporating all its various materials, but also on the individual impact of each building element (floor, ceilings, external walls, etc.) on the one hand, and on the impact of a predefined standard enclosed floor space (e.g. basement space, typical floor space, roof space) on the other. The first virtual cutting approach aims at breaking down the total kg CO(2)eq of each building to the functional unit of 1 m(2) of general floor space (in this case the energy reference area) for 1 year of the building's lifetime. This functional unit is commonly utilized for LCAs of buildings and facilitates a general comparison of the four apartment buildings by levelling out the differences in building sizes. It is, however, not the best way of showing clearly where exactly the main contributors to the final result are situated within the building. When looking at a building from an architect's point of view, there is no such thing as a general 1 m(2) of floor space to which the overall building emission results could be meaningfully allocated. Instead, each storey has its individual contributors to the final result. The floor element, for instance, only contributes to the lowest building storey, while the roof element normally only covers the top storey. In contrast, the external and internal walls are found on all storeys. Therefore, the second approach aims at systematically defining four typical storeys within a building (basement, ground floor, upper floor and loft) by their specific characteristics. The carbon emissions are then calculated for 1 m(2) of this specific floor space and 1 year of the building's lifetime. The objective of this second approach is to clarify the interrelations of the different individual parts of the buildings within their overall functional context, while at the same time allowing for a meaningful presentation and interpretation of their respective impacts with regard to embodied carbon emissions. Different perspectives and levels of detail are covered in the critical impact evaluation of each building, giving a thorough and comprehensible answer to the question of where its embodied CO2 is primarily located. While the first functional unit can be used in order to get a broad view of the embodied carbon emissions of the various building elements of the whole building, the second functional unit facilitates a more sophisticated allocation of the results, with regard to the anticipated location of the most relevant elements per storey. It can be observed that the second virtual cutting approach shows fewer individual differences and a more generic distribution of the carbon emission results of the four buildings compared with the results of the first cutting approach. Furthermore, using the second approach, the embodied emissions of an average square metre of basement, ground floor, upper floor and loft with a minimum and maximum deviation from the mean value can be determined.
   As the buildings within the depicted set exhibit a high level of variety with regard to their construction types and the embodied carbon emissions of their individual building elements, the rather high degree of homogeneity of the results as displayed by the second virtual cutting approach is especially remarkable. It was demonstrated that by schematically cutting the buildings on the basis of only a few simple conceptual assumptions about the specifications of each storey, a consistent comparison of a set of diverse buildings is feasible, and that quite similar results can be generated from the direct comparison of the same storey of the various buildings. Furthermore, determining the impact of a standard storey of basement, ground floor, upper floor and loft can help architects and planners to quickly evaluate the performance of their building. design by using these values as benchmarks, enabling them to localize which storey and which building elements bear the highest optimization potential for their specific project.

AB The paper analyzes how to comply with an emission constraint, which restricts the use of an established energy technique, given the two options to save energy and to invest in two alternative energy techniques. These techniques differ in their deterioration rates and the investment lags of the corresponding capital stocks. Thus, the paper takes a medium-term perspective on climate change mitigation, where the time horizon is too short for technological change to occur, but long enough for capital stocks to accumulate and deteriorate. It is shown that, in general, only one of the two alternative techniques prevails in the stationary state, although, both techniques might be utilized during the transition phase. Hence, while in a static economy only one technique is efficient, this is not necessarily true in a dynamic economy.

AB Ecological footprint (EFP) measures the amount of area, that is land or sea, which is required to absorb the waste generated through human activities or to support the production of resources consumed by populations. EFP index therefore includes six dimensions that are cropland, forestland, carbon, fishing grounds, grazing land, and built-up area. Human activities have impacted the environment, leading to global warming, widespread droughts, and diseases. The present study aims to investigate the role of renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency on the EFP index. Past researchers have widely used carbon emission (CE) to represent environmental impact, and recent studies have shown that EFP index is a better proxy of environmental degradation. Therefore, the present research differs from past studies in that it compares on how the determinants of environmental degradation affects EFP index and CE. Panel dataset of the OECD countries from 1990 to 2020 is employed. The CS-ARDL, DCCEMG, and AMG techniques, which overcome dynamics, heterogeneity, and cross-sectional dependence, are employed. The main findings depict that RE significantly reduces EFP and CE, while economic growth significantly exacerbates them. Energy efficiency reduces CE, but does not significantly affect EFP. Non-renewable energy and research & development significantly increase CE, while an insignificant positive effect is observed with EFP. This paper shows that factors that significantly influence CE may not always significantly affect the EFP index. Thus, to reduce environmental degradation it is fundamental to understand on how each dimension of EFP is influenced.

AB The construction industry in Europe significantly contributes to energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, and this has prompted the European Union to issue directives for renovating and decarbonizing the existing building stock to meet 2050's energy and environmental targets. However, achieving nearly zero-energy building (nZEB) standards in historic buildings is a complex challenge, as heritage values cannot be compromised for the sake of energy improvements. Our research advocates for a "whole building approach", integrating various disciplines to achieve low-energy retrofitting while preserving historical material authenticity. The proposed methodology, inspired by the EN16883:2017 standard, involves a comprehensive building survey and assessment, the definition of conservation-compatible design solutions, and a performance analysis of these selected measures in relation to nZEB standards. This method was then applied to an ongoing project on a small, listed building in Genoa, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving conservation and high energy savings and, in these specific circumstances, the possibility of approaching nZEB parameters. This best practice example highlights the importance of adopting a cross-disciplinary, structured method to balance different values and needs in retrofitting projects, and it shows how creative and innovative solutions can break down the typical barriers encountered when implementing retrofitting solutions for built heritage.

AB The capture of carbon and sequestration (CCS) activity is considered strategic in the context of world energy policy. In fact, CO2 emissions from fossil/conventional-fuel-fired power plants can be lowered by using CCS on the same. Various other methods have been developed to date to capture the carbon and store it. This article focuses on the various carbon capture technologies and the storage technologies such as pre-combustion, post-combustion, oxyfuel technology, and direct air capture (DAC) technology, including their subparts, along with the factors affecting the carbon capture technologies. The aim of the present study is to develop an overview of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies and CO2 sequestration, including a vast coverage of the various factors that have a huge impact on CCS. It emerged that the existing technologies that deal with CO2 sequestration and capture are being used at large scale to produce derivatives including chemicals, polymers, building materials, and various other products. The newest technology that has been seen creating a huge effect is direct air capture, and commercial use of such technologies has been seen. Future potential application areas have been realised in this review work. In addition, this article explores policy recommendations for the future.

AB Understanding all the possible greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources and factors is key to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, as targeted by the Paris Agreement, and thereby, averting the severe consequences of climate change. In this study, we explored household energy-related GHG (HEGHG) emissions in 265 residential neighbourhoods in a high-latitude city that experiences opposite temperature extremes. Our results revealed that the average annual per capita GHG emissions from dwellings in the city are 45% higher than those from personal transportation, highlighting the urgent need for greater emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from dwellings in high-latitude cities. We found that per capita floor area is positively correlated with GHG emissions. The findings also indicate that per capita HEGHG emissions significantly increase with increasing neighbourhood income levels (r = 0.8). An increase in the percentage of households struggling to afford homeownership is also associated with a decrease in HEGHG emissions (r = -0.3). These findings can help facilitate the focus on areas of high-latitude cities where the mitigation measures may have the most impact in reducing carbon footprint.

AB Energy efficiency in buildings and the mitigation of CO2 are key factors in the advancement of contemporary architecture, which includes aesthetic elements such as skylights, facades, and windows. Therefore, in this work the impact of different glazing types on energy savings and CO2 reduction was presented. A comparative analysis was conducted taking into account the climate oriented approach in a specific climate context, Aw Ko center dot ppen Climate Classification. Based on numerical results of the conjugate heat transfer in a two-dimensional geometry in a transient state, first, the glazing thermal performance under extreme weather conditions was evaluated, subsequently, an annual thermal evaluation was conducted. Triple glazing was highlighted as an effective option as it reduced heat loss by 56.5 % on the coldest day and reduced heat gain by 31.0 % on the warmest day in Me ' rida, Yucat ' an. Triple glazing also showed efficiency in reducing the total heat flux per unit area by 32.7 % under extreme temperature and solar radiation conditions, coldest day - south orientation and warmest day - west orientation. While glazing orientation showed a significant role in overheating, triple glazing decreased electricity consumption and CO2 emissions by 29 % per year, making it a leading choice for sustainable architecture.

AB As a result of the development of energy commercialization, integrated energy services can meet multiple forms of energy supply. In this paper, the cooperative game of a multi-park integrated energy system for industrial, commercial, and residential areas with hydrogen energy based on Nash bargaining theory is established towards the joint dispatching of parks with operation differences in energy sharing mode. Firstly, the techno-economic framework considering the difference of park integrated energy systems is built, whilst introducing the hydrogen-doped electric-to-gas process. Second, by taking into consideration the interests demands and individual differences of each park subject through the cooperative game, the operation representing the interests of the multi-park integrated energy system is established. Then, on the basis of ensuring that the proposed cooperative game model can maximize the social benefits, the original problem is transformed into two easier-to-solve sub-problems. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to successively solve the two sub-problems in a distributed manner. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed model can reduce the purchased cost by 1298.8199 $, operation cost by 2319.3456 $, and carbon emissions by 62.1281 t, and improve the renewable energy integration by 12.3011 MW compared with the non-cooperative operation.

AB Rural buildings have high optimization potential as a major source of carbon emissions. However, the current research on carbon reduction in rural buildings is rough and lacks categorization and geographic studies. Coastal villages are more economically developed than other types of villages and have greater potential for energy saving. Therefore, this study takes the carbon emission data of buildings and life in 409 villages in typical coastal provinces of China as the basis and proposes optimization strategies for carbon reduction in coastal village buildings via cluster analysis and correlation analysis. The results show that the carbon emission characteristics of coastal villages can be categorized into three scenarios: for scenario 1, villages, their population, and village cultivated area are the core influencing factors of carbon emission, while for scenarios 2 and 3, the most central influencing factors are coal and electricity consumption. Therefore, different types of villages should be guided differently when studying carbon sinks and carbon emission projections in coastal villages. This study aims to establish a low-carbon performance quality assessment and optimization pathway for coastal villages, and the analysis of carbon emission influencing factors and the assessment and optimization provide theoretical support and quantitative methods for the optimization of carbon reduction in villages.

AB Biodiversity loss caused by housing is not a well-defined sector of environmental impact. This research quantifies effects on biodiversity of an average Spanish Single-Family House (SFH) with 180 m2 of built surface. The current Spanish SFH stock GWP amounts to 1.16 Gt CO2eq in a 50-year life cycle, 40 % of which is embodied in the building materials and the 60 % are emissions due to the use of the building. This stock also impacts with 10.2 Gt 1,4-DCB the land, water and human health. SFHs also drive 6052 species extinct in a 50 year life cycle, and account for 3.03 M years of life lost due to premature death or lived with a disability. Divided by the 16 M people living in Spanish SFHs, each one lost 0.19 years of their lives (68.1 days) due to their home's impacts on human health. The article compares a reference conventional building against three low-impact cases, to understand how different building techniques and materials influence environmental outcomes that keep biodiversity loss the lowest possible. Scenarios include a standard brick and concrete house as Scenario 0 (SC0, Base), a timber Passivhaus as Scenario 1 (SC1), a straw-bale house with renewable energies as Scenario 2 (SC2), and an earth bioclimatic house as Scenario 3 (SC3). An initial Global Warming Potential (GWP) analysis was performed to relate previous building Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies with biodiversity metrics. Three main biodiversity metrics; ecotoxicity (as midpoint indicator), biodiversity loss and damage to human health (both as endpoint indicators) have been considered. Compared to SC0 with 1292 kgCO2-eq center dot m- 2 (516 embodied) of GWP, we found that SC1 emitted-47.0 % of that, SC2-41.4 % and SC3-80.9 %. Concerning ecotoxicity, where SC0 has 11,399 kg 1,4 DCB, the results are-27.9 % in SC1,-19.2 % in SC2, and-45.6 % in SC3. Regarding biodiversity loss, where SC0 has 7.54 E-06 species.yr center dot m- 2, the impacts are-30.9 % in SC1,-32.6 % in SC2, and-58.6 % in SC3.Human health damage in SC0 being 3.37 E-03 DALY, has been reduced in the timber home (SC1) is-44.2 %, of the Straw SFH (SC2)-39.2 %, and of the earth house (SC3)-67.1 %. This article shows that with current existing technological solutions GWP could be reduced in-80.9 %, ecotoxicity in-45.6 %, biodiversity loss in-58.6 % and human health in-67.1 %. Spanish Single-Family Houses built in timber, earth or straw-bale are real alternatives to current cement traditional building.

AB The incoordination between public transportation system construction and urban infrastructure development is a challenge for the sustainable development of cities. Exploring the associations between the built environment, transportation, and carbon emissions from a macro perspective is significant for realizing the goal of low-carbon urban transportation. This study proposes a collaborative optimization framework for the built environment and public transportation structure under carbon emission reduction. The purpose is to enhance the services capacity and emission reduction potential of public transportation with limited resources. Six factors are considered to construct the many-objective optimization model, including carbon emissions, energy consumption, government subsidies, time and economic costs, and road network resource occupation. The parameters of the model are calculated based on various multi-mode travel data (including vehicle order data, vehicle global positioning system (GPS) trajectory data, and intelligent card (IC) data) and built environment data. During the process, a data processing method for identifying bus drop-off points and inferring urban functional areas is developed. Then, the NSGA-III-DE (Differential Evolution) algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solutions. The methodological framework is validated in the experiment implemented in Shenzhen city. According to the hypervolume (HV) value, the performance of NSGA-III-DE is compared with that of NSGA-II and NSGA-III. The results show that NSGA-III-DE has better global search ability and presents stable performance for different mutation operators. Finally, the optimization results are further discussed to provide effective guidance for urban planning and low-carbon transportation.

AB The present study investigates the influence of rural-urban migration, construction sector share, and agriculture-irrigated land on environmental quality in urbanized Asian nations. For analysis, panel data from seven highly urbanized economies from 1996 to 2020 is utilized. The study employed an augmented mean group (AMG) estimator to find short and long-run results. The empirical discoveries depict that rural-urban migration increases energy demand in urbanized areas and significantly contributes to deteriorating environmental quality. The findings also reveal that the expansion of construction sectors is a significant source of high cement production, which also increases carbon emissions and environmental pollution by increasing the concentration of particulate matter in the atmosphere. The findings also exposed the role of agriculture-irrigated land, contributing to carbon emissions in urbanized Asian economies. The study also investigated the impact of the square term of irrigated agricultural land on environmental deterioration, revealing that adding agricultural land will further intensify environmental degradation by increasing carbon emissions in the atmosphere. A policy framework to reduce environmental damage in Asian economies caused by rural-to-urban migration, the building industry, and irrigated agricultural land was recommended based on the study's findings.

AB Ecosystems suffer from CO2 emissions and pollution caused by waste materials, mainly agricultural and industrial, that are dumped in landfill sites. These materials contain aluminosilicates, which are key ingredients for producing geopolymer composite (GPC). While cement, the main component of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), is a highly energy-consuming and polluting material in terms of CO2 emissions, water absorption, and land depletion, GPC is an emerging building material that can contribute to the sustainability of the construction industry. In this research, bibliometric data on GPCs were collected from Dimensions databases, and a scientometric analysis was performed using the innovative VOSviewer software (ver. 1.6.19). The scope was to examine the development of GPC for construction applications in the context of a circular economy and as an emerging green building material. Using specific query metrics and three keywords (geopolymer, circular economy, and green building materials), bibliometric records were analyzed to identify the articles, authors, and journals with the highest impact. This investigation can help scholars and policymakers in deepening their knowledge in this growing research area. From a societal perspective, this study stimulates geopolymer developments through policies aimed at promoting the circular economy, such as the adoption of green subsidies in research and development (R&D) and production.

AB In dense, energy-demanding urban areas, the effective utilization of solar energy resources, encompassing building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems and solar water heating (SWH) systems inside buildings, holds paramount importance for addressing concerns related to carbon emission reduction and the balance of energy supply and demand. This study aimed to examine the interplay between urban residential blocks and their solar energy potential, with the objective of promoting environmentally sustainable development within urban residential areas. The primary focus of this study was the hot summer and cold winter zone of China, which serves as a representative case study. Methodologically, we employed Rhinoceros and Grasshopper (GH) software version GH6.0 tools to simulate the solar radiation potential within residential blocks and translated this information into the potential utilization of BIPV and SWH systems. Subsequently, our focus was directed towards identifying optimal locations for mounting BIPV modules and water heaters on roofs and building facades. The study results revealed the following: (1) The floor area ratio (FAR), building density (BD), average building height (ABH), and space layout (SL) exerted substantial influences on the solar potential of a residential block, with correlations of up to 75%, 71%, 78%, and 50%, respectively, concerning the overall solar potential of the entire plot. (2) It is essential to emphasize that, with regard to the BIPV installation potential, facades account for 80% of the overall residential block potential, whereas rooftops contribute only 20%. Both south- and west-facing facades exhibited a BIPV installation ratio of approximately 34%. (3) In the realm of solar water heating, the potential for installations on building facades accounted for 77% of the total living area of the residential blocks, 23% on the rooftops, and 35% on the south-facing facades. This study furnishes practical guidelines for harnessing the potential of BIPV and SWH systems within residential blocks, thereby contributing to the advancement of sustainable urban development practices.

AB Carbon footprint (CF) estimation has emerged as an integral tool for greenhouse gas (GHG) management, providing direction for emission reduction strategies and verification processes. Since capturing the full lifecycle emissions of goods and services at the city level can be methodologically challenging due to the fact that cities have multiple sources of emissions (e.g. transportation, waste, buildings), our study focused on evaluating the carbon footprint of various types of urban buildings across six sectors. This evaluation was conducted in one of the most rapidly urbanized cities in the Middle East, Doha City, Qatar, and was based on electricity consumption data from 2017 to 2020. Using multiregional input-output life cycle assessment (MRIO-LCA) and hot/coldspot analysis, this study identified CF emission spatiotemporal patterns and the major buildings responsible for the highest emissions. The results indicated that residential villas and the commercial sector had the highest electricity consumption and steady increases in CF emissions during the study period, whereas hotels had the lowest annual electricity consumption among all sectors. The study also identified significant CF emission hotspots from Doha residential buildings in the southwestern and northeastern areas. In contrast, the CF hotspots from commercial buildings were concentrated in the industrial area in the southern part of the city and in the West Bay area in the eastern part. Overall, the findings of this study provide important policy implications and a comprehensive assessment of dynamic changes in CF emissions from different building types.

AB The significant environmental impact of buildings during their lifecycle has made it a critical area to address the global climate crisis. However, due to the involvement of multiple industrial sectors, a large number of related parties, and the complexity of environmental information flows in the whole lifecycle of buildings, the effectiveness of the traditional centralized management approach is limited, and it is necessary to adopt more advanced management technology tools. With its decentralized, transparent, and secure characteristics, blockchain technology has triggered various applications in several industries, as well as in the field of building environmental sustainability. Using bibliometric and content analysis, this paper comprehensively reviews the current state of research on blockchain technology in the field of building environmental sustainability. A total of 128 articles were reviewed, revealing that blockchain technology has been used to address various types of environmental problems in multiple stages of the building lifecycle, including building material production, construction, operation, and demolition phases, etc. It is shown that blockchain technology can already effectively improve the use of renewable energy and reduce overall energy consumption during the building operation phase, while the great potential for solving other environmental issues, such as the management of building embodied carbon emissions, needs to be further explored. This paper also explores potential research opportunities and future directions based on current gaps and limitations, presenting several critical topics from the perspective of building lifecycle and practice support. This review helps related researchers gain insights into the research frontier and future direction.

AB An important issue today is whether gasoline vehicles should be replaced by flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) that use ethanol-gasoline blends (e.g., E85), where some carbon dioxide (CO2) from ethanol's production is captured and piped, or battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) powered by wind or solar. This paper compares the options in a case study. It evaluates a proposal to capture fermentation CO2 from 34 ethanol refineries in 5 U.S. states and build an elaborate pipeline to transport the CO2 to an underground storage site. This "ethanol plan" is compared with building wind farms at the same cost to provide electricity for BEVs ("wind plan A"). Compared with the ethanol plan, wind plan A may reduce 2.4-4 times the CO2, save drivers in the five states $40-$66 billion (USD 2023) over 30 years even when BEVs initially cost $21,700 more than FFVs, require 1/400,000th the land footprint and 1/10th-1/20th the spacing area, and decrease air pollution. Even building wind to replace coal ("wind plan B") may avoid 1.5-2.5 times the CO2 as the ethanol plan. Thus, ethanol with carbon capture appears to be an opportunity cost that may damage climate and air quality, occupy land, and saddle consumers with high fuel costs for decades.

AB Iran has increased its CO2 emissions significantly during the past few decades. The household sector in Iran contributes one of the largest sectors of CO2 emissions. Despite this significant contribution, the existing policies have predominantly concentrated on large-scale initiatives while overlooking the regional role in shaping and implementing these plans. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between CO2 emissions and the efficient factors in three major groups including energy, climate, and household socio-economic factors. This study aims to address regional carbon emissions and develop CO2 reduction policies tailored to each region's specific circumstances. It focuses on planning strategies at the regional level to effectively tackle CO2 emissions. Household panel data of 28 provinces of Iran are employed by using both static and dynamic panel models for the years 2001 to 2019. Static estimation includes Fixed Effect (FE), Random Effect (RE) and pooled Partial least squares (PLS), Dynamic estimation includes difference Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The empirical result of the static method showed positive dependence of household CO2 emissions on Heating Degree Days (HDD), Cooling Degree Days (CDD), precipitation level, oil consumption, gas consumption, household income, size of household, and also building stocks. In more detail, educational rate, dummy variable (removal of energy subsidy), and oil price reveal the greatest negative impact on the emissions with elasticities of - 0.428, - 0.31, and - 0.15; It represents 1% increase causes - 0.428, - 0.31, - 0.15, decrease CO2 emissions, respectively. however, household size, gas consumption, and oil consumption show the most significant positive effects on CO2 emissions with 1 percent increase causes CO(2)emissions increases by 0.1, 0.044, and 0.026, respectively. Regarding the impact of climate factors, a 1% increase in Heating Degree Days, Cooling Degree Days, and precipitation level causes CO2 emissions increase by 0.024%, 0.004%, and 0.011% respectively, due to an increase in fossil energy demand. Results of the dynamic method of the system Generalized Method of Moments are similar to the static estimation results, except for that household size and urbanization are not significant. Also, removing the energy subsidy for fossil fuels due to substantial subsidy in fossil fuels in Iran or implementing a re-pricing energy policy can be a beneficial way to control carbon emissions from households within the provinces of the country. However, it is important to consider that this shift could potentially transfer subsidies to investments in the private sector for renewable energies.

AB With the expansion of urban areas and the growth of welfare levels, the energy consumption of buildings will increase in the next decades. Passive solar systems are one of the technologies to reduce energy consumption. In this paper, a building-integrated passive solar energy technology was studied in six different Scenarios including photovoltaic (PV) and Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) glazing windows, PV glazing facades, PV glazing double-skin facade, and simple double-skin facade. They were compared to the base model, respectively. It has been determined each scenario may be superior in one or more cases compared to other scenarios. Results show in the BIPV model, the inside temperature of the building was decreased by up to 1.3 degrees. The annual energy consumption for heating in the double-skin Scenario was reduced by about 17% compared to the base Scenario. The annual energy consumption for cooling in the building with PV glazing facade compared to the base scenario has decreased by more than 21%. Annually, CO2 emissions by 140%, and the cost of energy have decreased by 3493.4$ in building with PV glazing double skin facade and building with PV glazing facade, respectively. Finally, the shadow effect of the energy of the building is examined.

AB Energy efficiency analysis for space heating is based on MESP Regulation no. 04/18 for Minimum Requirements for Energy Performance of Buildings according to the reference model M-Type R. The M-Type R model represents the building reference model for buildings built from 1960 to 2017, M-Type A: E. The study is conducted on the comparison of UA: E [W/m2K] heat transfer coefficients for the envelope surfaces of multi-family houses (walls, exterior doors, and windows, basement, and roof) according to years of construction with UR [W/m2K] based on heat transfer coefficient as well as the ratio of specific heat coefficients UA: E/UR [-]. For these buildings are presented depending on the construction periods: the number of buildings, the number, and area of housing units as well as the types of materials used to build their enclosure. The analysis of energy savings for heating is done considering only the heat losses in the building envelope (transmission losses). By the obtained results it can be concluded that the consumption of energy for heating is too high and with the measures for energy efficiency for heating there will be savings of energy for heating as well as reductions in CO2 emissions per stock of multi-family houses which is 2,125,776 m2, the number of buildings is 2,939 with 40,886 residential units.

AB The end-of-life phase of buildings has not found adequate representation in the literature despite affording opportunities for reclaiming precious construction material and energy savings from the reuse and recycling of demolition waste. Moreover, the extant literature has limited the research focus primarily to the energy analysis of only the building portion, while the associated components, such as mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) services and site features, are generally excluded from study scope. Furthermore, the majority of research studies in this area have excluded the demolition of buildings using controlled explosion. The current study aims to address these research gaps with a view to estimate the demolition energy requirements for the prospective demolition of a recently constructed high-rise residential building, including all connected services and site features. The demolition is executed using a hybrid method comprising deconstruction, mechanical demolition, and controlled explosion.The results indicate that, although building-related sub-systems accounted for approximately 80% of demolition waste and demolition energy requirements, non-building sub-systems, including MEP services, represented a considerable share of about 20% and thus should not be ignored. The overall waste generation rate of the building project is estimated to be about 1715 kg/m(2).Concrete contributed to the highest proportions of demolition waste (73.20%) and demolition energy consumption (84.46%), while steel scrap enabled the highest amount of embodied energy recovery (90.46%) in recycling. Overall, the demolition project resulted in the recovery of nearly 2.70% of the embodied energy consumed during the pre-occupation stage of the building project life cycle.The findings of this study are expected to be useful to stakeholders in identifying opportunities to reduce the demolition energy footprint to make the end-of-life stage of a building project more sustainable. The study also establishes the need for emergent policy initiatives on the revision of guidelines for demolition waste management based on the realistic waste generation rate of high-rise residential buildings; the establishment of waste exchanges to reduce landfill space requirements; and incentivizing the use of recycled products in new constructions. Additionally, some relevant areas have been suggested for further research.

AB Integrating a BIM-based life-cycle assessment (LCA) in the early design stages of building projects can promote a reduction of environmental impacts. However, the reliability of the analysis depends on the quality of the model. BIM modelling of timber-frame construction is often simplified, potentially hindering the LCA outcome due to quantity inaccuracy and a failure to consider elements regarded as negligible. This study addresses the meth-odological problem that influences the calculation of the environmental impact by examining the various environmental impacts caused by inventory data obtained from BIM models with a level of detail of (LOD) 350-400 vs LOD200. The environmental impacts obtained from both models of a timber building calculated through an attributional LCA method are compared. Material inventory sourced from the LOD200 model results in a 14.7% lower value of embodied impact. The discrepancies resulted from aluminium, mineral wool and bitumen, which are identified as critical materials requiring quantity adjustment. Relying on simplified BIM models for LCA may lead to the GWP being under-estimated with incorrect identification of hotspots in the early design stages. The results aksi question the cut-off criterion of the current EN15978 norm that serves as a foundation for developing environmental policies within the industry. It recommends exclusion of materials constituting less than 1% of the overall mass from the system boundary. This study underscores the potential significance of materials falling below this threshold, challenging the validity of the criterion, and suggesting that such materials should be carefully evaluated and included in the LCA to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts. The overall objective of the study is to emphasize the importance of employing accurate BIM models in LCAs to make informed decisions that are aligned with the sustainability goals, encouraging practitioners to consider the impact of critical materials, even those with seemingly minimal con-tributions. With this knowledge, the practitioners are able to take meaningful actions that compensate for the LCA uncertainty, mitigating the environmental burden of the most impactful areas. Most importantly, the findings aim to identify the error in design LCA versus as-built studies, helping to develop design LCA tools that predict the as-built impact more precisely and earlier in the design process. The findings can also improve the expected building model definition in carbon policies.

AB Cities are highly dense areas with significant energy consumption and waste generation. Therefore, developing buildings with low energy consumption and reduced pollutant emissions is an important approach for China to achieve its goals of carbon neutrality, peak carbon emissions, and sustainable development. In this context, the concept and practice of green buildings have emerged. This research is based on the whole life cycle assessment method of the whole life cycle theory, integrating relevant indicators for calculating carbon emissions in buildings. It conducts a multidimensional evaluation and analysis of the low-carbon level of green buildings. Quantitative analysis is carried out based on five stages and five dimensions of the entire construction process. A conceptual model for the low-carbon evaluation of green buildings is established, and grey relational analysis and analytic hierarchy process are employed to rank and evaluate projects. The study aims to identify the key factors in the low-carbon evaluation of green buildings and discusses the focus and suggestions for future low-carbon management throughout the whole life cycle of green buildings.

AB BackgroundConducting an extensive study on the spatial heterogeneity of the overall carbon budget and its influencing factors and the decoupling status of carbon emissions from economic development, by undertaking simulation projections under different carbon emission scenarios is crucial for China to achieve its targets to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. There are large disparities in carbon emissions from energy consumption, the extent of land used for carbon absorption, and the status of decoupling of emissions from economic development, among various regions of China.ResultsBased on night light data and land use data, we investigated carbon budget through model estimation, decoupling analysis, and scenario simulation. The results show that the carbon deficit had a continuous upward trend from 2000 to 2018, and there was a significant positive spatial correlation. The overall status of decoupling first improved and then deteriorated. Altogether, energy consumption intensity, population density of built-up land, and built-up land area influenced the decoupling of carbon emissions from economic development. There are significant scenarios of carbon emissions from energy consumption for the study area during the forecast period, only in the low-carbon scenario will the study area reach the expected carbon emissions peak ahead of schedule in 2027; the peak carbon emissions will be 6479.27 million tons.ConclusionsChina's provincial-scale carbon emissions show a positive correlation with economic development within the study period. It is necessary to optimize the economic structure, transforming the economic development mode, and formulating policies to control the expansion of built-up land. Efforts must be made to improve technology and promote industrial restructuring, to effectively reduce energy consumption intensity.

AB Green roofs have the potential to reduce carbon dioxide directly through photosynthesis and indirectly through building energy savings. Most previous studies either focused exclusively on the direct or indirect CO2 reduction of GRs, resulting in an incomplete assessment. A comprehensive assessment of the CO2 reduction potential of GRs would aid in promoting their use as carbon credits in the carbon trading market. This study quantifies the total CO2 reductions from a newly built intensive green roof with yearlong carbon flux observations and building energy simulations. Our results indicate that direct and indirect carbon reductions from IGR significantly differ, with the monthly direct and indirect CO2 reduction ratio ranging from 1:5 to 1:130. Direct and indirect CO2 reduction exhibits significant seasonal trends, with peak direct reduction in autumn and peak indirect reduction in summer. Overall, the total annual CO2 reduction from this IGR system is 4355.6 g CO2 center dot m (-2), of which 46.6 g CO2 center dot m (-2) and 4309 g CO2 center dot m (-2) were direct and indirect, respectively. Further research should evaluate the longterm integrated carbon reduction over the life cycle of the GRs. The findings of this study could provide evidence to leverage GRs as a nature-based solution to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.

AB The building sector is responsible for approximately 40% of global energy consumption and carbon emissions, making it a key area of focus in addressing the urgent global challenge of climate change and in achieving the 1.5-degree target. This study concentrated on building decarbonization, using bibliometric and network visualization analyses based on a dataset of 2494 publications retrieved from the Web of Science up to 25 June 2023. Findings revealed a rapid growth in publications, with China being the largest contributor (approximately 31%). Notably, the journals of Cleaner Production and Applied Energy emerged as the most influential journal in this field. Although leadership teams and authors have gained prominence, cross-national collaboration and communication among them remain limited. Furthermore, an analysis of keywords and co-citations revealed that the main research themes and hotspots encompass "energy", "life cycle assessment", "storage", and related "models" and decarbonization "strategies". As the field progresses, a clear trend toward multidisciplinary integration and diversified research directions and content was observed. Researchers can further concentrate their efforts on countries with historically limited research but substantial emissions, and enhance international collaboration and interdisciplinary integration. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for researchers and facilitates future investigations in the field of building decarbonization.

AB The low-carbon retrofitting of industrial heritage communities is an important issue for reducing urban carbon emissions. Previous research on the judgment of heritage elements and carbon emission factors of industrial heritage communities lacked the construction of elements within the space, and the value judgment of conservation and the determination of low-carbon factors lacked a systematic network analysis. Carbon spatial networks as a systematic approach can systematically harmonize the contradictions between "conservation-transformation-low carbon" while considering the spatial and temporal carbon emissions of nodes. This research uses hierarchical analysis to analyze the value of heritage elements and locate them in space, then combine the elements that affect carbon activities in space to form carbon space nodes integrated with heritage conservation elements, and analyze the links between nodes to form a carbon space network. Then, this research uses a carbon spatial network to dissect the structure of carbon emissions, calculate the carbon activity at nodes, and reflect it into a parameterized platform to guide designers. After that, this research selected 16 industrial heritage communities in the severe cold region for the carbon activity measurement of carbon spatial network node elements in the operation stage and conducted a correlation analysis to obtain a correlation matrix model of node elements and carbon activities. Within the constraints of heritage element protection, the results show that the volume ratio, green area ratio, and building density of the carbon spatial network model have the greatest influence on its carbon performance, followed by porosity and road density. Through case simulation verification, the floor area ratio of industrial heritage communities should be controlled between 2.1-2.5, the number of residential building floors should be 7-14, the road network density should be 4.16-4.50%, the green space ratio should be 20-35%, and the porosity should be 35-45%. Taking the three major power road communities in Harbin as an example, retrofit measures were decided by reference to relevant parameter control intervals, resulting in a 21.1% reduction in energy consumption, an approximate 32.7% reduction in carbon emissions, and a 7.3% reduction in the annual percentage of hours in extreme hot and cold environments.

AB Cities have a significant role in the current climate change and air pollution crisis; hence, it is urgent to mitigate the negative effects of pollution in urban settlements. This situation requires developing agile plans to simultaneously investigate the efficiency of green infrastructures and feedback from their targets. A crucial consideration for these plans is the potential rooftops have - broadly abundant and underused in urban areas - to harbour sustainable, effective, and viable alternatives. This study aims to develop a new model to optimize the utilization of feasible pollutant reducers, investigate the ability rooftops present to reduce air pollution and recommend the most suitable city-scale solutions. The proposed model combines mathematical patterns, GIS, and sensitivity analysis. This systematic and adaptable approach was first applied to heavily air-polluted Tehran city, which has vastly unused rooftops. This leading application identified: i) two appropriate pollutant reducing alternatives - photovoltaic and green roofs -; ii) optimized total performance alternative when simultaneous mitigation of PM and CO2 is required - compound alternative -; iii) three significant indicators for target building groups - land use, building height, and surface scale -; and iv) the most suitable group - residential medium height in medium surface scale buildings. Applying a compound alternative with a 3:1 ratio (photovoltaic:green roof) to all potential target buildings enables a 9% decrease in the total city level for PM and CO2 emissions.

AB Both the operational phase and embodied emissions that are introduced during the construction phase through the manufacture, sourcing, and installation of the building's materials and components are significant contributors to carbon emissions from the built environment. It is essential to change the current design and (re)construction processes in order to achieve the energy-saving targets for the EU building stock and move toward a society that is net carbon neutral. This change must be made from both a technical perspective as well as from a methodological perspective. To accomplish this, the EU has suggested several regulations and legislative steps to phase out inefficient structures. The most recent of these initiatives propose the idea of a Digital Building Logbook, which serves as a central repository for all pertinent building data, including information on energy efficiency. In this work, we present a survey of the elements that have been taken into consideration for the creation of the Digital Building Logbook to give an overview of what research has been done so far.

AB Higher demand for refrigeration systems adversely affects power grids, causing blackouts, increased electricity expenses, and carbon emissions. However, using renewable energy thermally driven refrigeration absorption systems is a promising alternative. The higher initial cost and dependency on local weather, large space area for installation, and complex design are hurdles for the widespread of these systems compared to the conventional vapor compression refrigeration systems. This study uses response surface methodology to model a real vapor absorption machine (VAM) incorporated with the measured data. This VAM is the refrigeration machine of a solar-powered absorption cooling system (SPACS) integrated with thermal energy storage for milk chilling installed and operated in Jaipur (India). The weather data for 2022 is used in performance and productivity analysis in this study. The results show that most of the summer months, the system can produce desired cooling to take down the 1000 l of milk within 3 h as per standards ISO 5708 - 2 II. Moreover, the solar loop still has sufficient driving heat to charge the 1000 l cold storage tank/another milk tank. During winter days, it takes a significant system response time (SRT) to reach the thermal energy storage (TES) up to 95 degrees C; after that, VAM operates significantly underperforming due to weak solar insolation; even the system cannot provide cooling to the first milking. The system produces monthly cooling energy of up to 2356 kWh in summer and is reduced to 620 kWh during monsoon and winter. The maximum value of the coefficient of performance (COPVAM) is achieved as 0.55 with an average of 0.41-0.46 during summer months whereas 0.34-0.39 during monsoon and winter days. The system's energy efficiency ratio (EER) ranges from 2.5 to 6.5, with an overall average of 4.55, which is far better than the conventional vapor compression refrigeration systems. The LCOE for the SPACS has been estimated to be 0.177 $/kWh, whereas the simple payback period is 12.4 years, and the discounted payback period is 19.7 years.

AB The aim of this research is to design an environmentally sustainable living system for residential buildings by optimizing both on-grid and off-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems. The primary goal is to reduce carbon emissions. The study focuses on a typical residential building comprising 10 apartments, each with a floor area of 150 m2. To meet the electrical demand, a rooftop PV system is utilized. Energy consumption is modeled using the BEopt software with an accuracy margin of less than 5%. The PVsyst software is employed to simulate the behavior and productivity of the system over the course of a year. The study aims to optimize both the on-grid and off-grid components of the system to identify the most cost-effective solution for energy consumption. To validate the proposed system, various optimization scenarios are considered, leading to the selection of specific components: a 15.5 kWh Li-Ion battery, a 3.7 kW inverter, and 8 modules of 555 W. The modules are configured with 4 in series and 2 in parallel. Based on the results obtained from the five optimization scenarios, the study concludes that a 10.6 kWh battery storage system is the optimal choice. This system can cover more than 95% of the electrical load and has a payback period of 5.7 years, along with a high net present value. If this model is adopted in apartment buildings throughout Jordan, it has the potential to mitigate approximately 5.33 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

AB This study examines the potential strategies for reducing embodied energy and greenhouse gas emissions through adaptive reuse of non-residential buildings for residential purposes, as compared to new construction of apartment buildings. Such an approach can address housing crises in urban areas with an abundance of underutilized non-residential buildings, promoting sustainable housing growth. A comprehensive assessment of repurposing in California reveals approximately 510 million m2 of floor space across 230,000 non-residential buildings in the current building stock. The potential reduction in embodied energy and CO2eq emissions ranges from 0.14 to 1.4 billion GJ and 5.0-70 million metric tons for the state, respectively, contingent upon the percentage of repurposed floor space (10-100%) and adaptive reuse scenario (retaining structural components and facade or solely the structure). A repurposed building avoids about 56% of embodied energy, 34-48% of CO2 eq emissions, and 72% of materials by mass compared to building a new apartment building. However, various technical, financial, and regulatory challenges may hinder emissions reductions, necessitating proactive policy measures. Cities can potentially expedite the process by streamlining approvals for mixed-use adaptive reuse projects involving both commercial and residential spaces.

AB Carbon-neutral strategies have become the focus of international attention, and many countries around the world have adopted building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technologies to achieve low-carbon building operation by utilizing power-generating building materials to generate energy in buildings. The purpose of this study is to review the basic status of the development of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technologies in China, to identify and analyze the existing problems and challenges, and to propose optimization strategies and methods so as to better promote the overall development of green buildings and net-zero energy consumption buildings in China and the world. Primarily, the research area of BIPV is focused on the Chinese region through a case study approach. Subsequently, it elaborates on the theoretical basis of zero-net energy buildings and BIPV as well as the current status of the construction of the world's low-carbon building standard system, and it summarizes the annual electricity generation of zero carbon buildings adopting BIPV in some European countries. Then, the article further quantitatively and comprehensively analyzes six successful BIPV application cases in China, and it graphically and visually evaluates and demonstrates the average annual net-zero energy performance percentage of the application cases by using the EPI evaluation and measurement tool. At the same time, based on the results of the above assessment, the challenges facing the development of BIPV in China are summarized, and specific incentives for new BIPVs are proposed to address the challenges as well as strategic approaches to optimize BIPVs that are applicable to China as well as Europe and the US. Ultimately, it is concluded that several classic BIPV building cases have achieved essentially 100% net-zero energy operation and maintenance with significant reductions in CO2 emissions and savings of tens of thousands of tonnes of coal consumption. This shows that BIPV technology is gradually developing and maturing in China, and there are great advantages and incremental development space for promoting BIPV in China in the future. The application and promotion strategy of its results in China is also applicable to other countries in the world. It is hoped that based on this experience, countries around the world will implement the "carbon neutral" strategy and zero-net energy consumption development more efficiently and with higher quality so as to realize a greener and cleaner future.

AB In order to explore the intelligent algorithms that can be used in the modern design of rural green buildings, this paper conducts factor analysis based on the modern design requirements of rural green buildings and constructs a data mining algorithm suitable for factor analysis of rural green buildings on the basis of quantitative analysis. Data mining technology uses energy consumption software to simulate and analyze the energy consumption of the building, calculate the energy consumption in the normal operation stage, calculate the corresponding energy consumption and multiply it by the carbon emission factor of the corresponding energy to derive the carbon emissions during the operation phase. In addition, this paper combines the actual situation of rural green buildings to conduct a multi-faceted architectural case analysis and combines the actual situation to construct a system functional structure. Finally, this paper verifies the method proposed in this paper through experimental research. From the research results, it can be seen that the method proposed in this paper has a better effect.

AB Quantifying embodied energy and emissions (EEEs) can help clarify the consumption-based responsibilities of the building sector. Material consumption accounts for over 80% of the total EEEs, which is substantially affected by cleaner production measures in the material industry. Previous studies have not accurately calculated the EEEs by overlooking or oversimplifying these effects. This study aims to address this issue by making predictions about the building sector of Mainland China, which includes the floor areas of new buildings and the related material consumption between 2020 and 2035. In total, 29 cleaner production measures for steel, cement, brick, glass, and timber industries are collected. The embodied energy and CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM emissions reduction effects of the adopted measures are quantified and analysed using conservation supply curve and uncertainty analysis approaches. The results show the EEEs from material consumption will decrease by 45.9-60.7% from 2020 to 2035, to which the cleaner production measures contribute about half. The EEEs have significant spatial disparity. For example, Guangdong Province takes 2% of China's land area, but undertakes 7-9% of the domestic EEEs. The uneven distributions may cause heavy energy and environmental pressures in some provinces. The specific costs of the EEEs reductions differ by 2-4 orders of magnitude, while 30.4-34.5% and 65.5-67.8% of the embodied energy and CO2 emission reduction effects are cost-effective. This study reveals the vital role of cleaner production in EEEs reductions and provides critical insights into the green development of the building sector.

AB Residential buildings generate significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and consume energy throughout their life cycle. In recent years, research on GHG emissions and energy consumption of buildings has developed rapidly in response to the growing climate change and energy crisis. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an important method for evaluating the environmental impacts of the building sector. However, LCA studies of buildings show widely varying outcomes across the world. Besides, environmental impact assessment from a whole life cycle perspective has been undeveloped and slow. Our work presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of LCA studies on GHG emissions and energy consumption in the preuse, use, and demolition stages of residential buildings. We aim to examine the differences among the results of diverse case studies and demonstrate the spectrum of variations under contextual disparities. Results show that residential building emits about 2928 kg GHG emission and consumes about 7430 kWh of energy per m(2) of gross building area on average throughout the life cycle. Residential buildings have an average GHG emission of 84.81% in the use phase, followed by the preuse phase and demolition phase; the mean energy consumption in the use stage occupied the largest share of 84.52%, followed by preuse stage and demolition stage. GHG emissions and energy use vary significantly in different regions due to different building types, natural conditions, and lifestyles. Our study stresses the compelling requirement to slash GHG emissions and optimize energy consumption from residential buildings by use of low carbon building materials, energy structure adjustment, consumer behavior transformation, etc.

AB A performance-based approach for assessing the environmental impact of masonry buildings is proposed. This new method combines Life Cycle Assessment and operational energy (OE) simulations to compare the cradle-touse environmental performance of a reference building composed of single core masonry walls made of Calcium Silicate Bricks (CSB) and Clay Bricks in Germany over a period of 50 years. To achieve this, a detailed processbased life cycle inventory and a methodology that combines material embodied footprints with operational energy simulations is developed, while also considering the vertical limit state for loading the walls. The study also considers the impact of future electricity mixes, the efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and the effect of lime-based construction materials carbonation on the optimal insulation thickness for a reference building. Results show that the OE consumption is the dominant phase in the overall environmental performance of current masonry buildings. Moreover, the balance between the material embodied footprint (MEF) and the OE at use phase, strongly depends on the impact category under study. If fully renewable-based electricity supply and highly efficient heat pumps are implemented, the role of MEF plays a decisive role, particularly in terms of climate change and resource availability damage areas. Moreover, the role of carbonation in CSB may contribute to up to 20% of carbon footprint reduction at a building scale.

AB Low-carbon parks composed of concentrated and contiguous low-carbon buildings has the characteristics of the high proportion of renewable energy penetration and low-carbon operation, requiring the transformation of relevant energy supply systems from being centralized to being centralized and distributed. However, the centralized and distributed energy supply method faces low levels of renewable energy utilization. Therefore, in this study, a low-carbon park energy system is constructed with a core of photovoltaics, wind power, lithium batteries, and heat storage tanks. A multi-parameter collaborative optimization method is proposed with the goals of cost reduction, carbon reduction, and independence by considering the parameters of equipment configuration and operation. The comprehensive benefits of a low-carbon park energy system under each lowcarbon park are explored. The advantages of the system in terms of monthly carbon emission intensity, operation cost, maintenance cost, and interactive power are analysed. For the system, the balance of its energy supply and demand on a typical day and the role of energy storage in improving its utilization of renewable energy are analysed. Finally, the feasibility and benefits of the system's energy supply in different climate zones are further studied. The results show that the energy supply cost, carbon emissions, and interactive power are 31.0 CNY/m2, 4.1 kg/m2, and 2.4 kWh/m2, respectively, resulting in the best benefits for a unit area in a low-carbon park energy system in a high-rise residential park (Beijing). Energy storage can effectively improve the levels of renewable energy utilization, energy conservation and carbon reduction in the system. The low-carbon park energy system proposed in this article can significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions in the construction industry.

AB A vertical extension (VE) involves the construction of additional floor space on top of an existing base building. With growing urban populations and an urgency to reduce building-related carbon emissions, VEs might have the potential to be a sustainable and innovative solution to overcome the shortage of urban spaces. However, despite the growing number of projects and the emerging academic literature, limited research has documented the decisions that inform the development of VE projects or the lessons learned from stakeholders that were involved in their creation. This paper presents the early decision-making processes that are undertaken to select a VE as an appropriate development type to construct in practice, and the common challenges and solutions during its realization, through semistructured interviews with a broad range of stakeholders, including developers, contractors, architects, and structural engineers that have been involved in recently completed VE projects. The results identify that the main driver of VEs is economic profit, followed by sustainability goals and the desire to stay on the same site. The challenges are related to the complex design and coordination of VE projects, and onsite construction challenges. In addition, this paper identifies the diverse structural support and reinforcement strategies that are used in VEs and contributes to the knowledge by capturing the different aesthetic and construction approaches that are used in practice.

AB This article deals with the determination of the impact of selected parameters on energy consumption for heating and cooling purposes and CO2 emissions. Mathematical modelling combined with planning a computational experiment was adopted as the research method. The database for creating the models was developed using building energy simulations performed with DesignBuilder software. A single-family house with an area of 101 m(2) was the subject of this study. Four deterministic mathematical models for the estimation of annual energy demand for heating, cooling, total final energy demand, and CO2 emissions were developed. Four parameters affecting the energy balance of the house: the area of the glazing system (three levels), U-value of windows (two-, three- and four-pane), U-value of external walls (0.1, 0.15, 0.2 W/m(2)K) and location (Warsaw, Berlin, Paris) were considered. The article discusses in detail the influence of individual factors on the energy demand and their common interactions. It was found that the level of thermal insulation of the glazing system plays the most important role in saving energy. This factor was the only one to show a stable and significant reduction in house energy demand, and thus a reduction in CO2 emissions for all four objective functions.

AB With the continuous development of the social economy, carbon emissions from various buildings are increasing. As the most important category of building carbon emissions, the rapid peaking of public buildings is an important part of achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality. This paper is based on the industrial background of the energy consumption structure of Henan Province, a central province in the developing country of China. Firstly, the energy consumption intensity of buildings and public buildings in Henan Province from 2010 to 2020 was calculated according to the energy balance sheet. The Kaya-LMDI decomposition method was also used to analyse the carbon emissions of public buildings, determining the impact of each influencing parameter on public buildings. Secondly, the scenario prediction model Monte Carlo was run 100,000 times to set the stochastic parameters of the variables in the model to predict the time of carbon peak and carbon emissions. The analysis results indicated that: (1) Carbon emissions in Henan Province have exhibited a steady growth trend, increasing from 1533 t in 2010 to 6561 t in 2020; (2) The primary factors influencing carbon emissions of public buildings in Henan Province were urbanization rate, public floor area per capita, and energy intensity per unit of public floor area; and (3) Carbon emissions of public buildings in Henan Province followed an inverted U-shaped distribution and are expected to peak at approximately 7423 t by the year 2035. The research method in this paper can guide the simulation study of peak carbon emission prediction in Henan Province based on the influencing parameters of carbon emission from different types of buildings. Moreover, the results of this paper can provide a reference for a more precise study of building carbon reduction in similar regions of developing countries.

AB The differences in CO2 equivalent emissions and carbon compensation due to land use changes can provide a basis for formulating low-carbon development policies in various regions according to net CO2 emissions. Based on the land use and energy consumption data of Hunan Province from 2000 to 2020, the calculation model is constructed to calculate the CO2 equivalent emissions and carbon compensation values for different cities in different periods. The results showed that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, there was a significant growth trend in the area of built-up land in Hunan Province, mainly from the forest and cropland, while the area of forest is relatively stable. (2) The net CO2 equivalent emissions from land use changes in Hunan Province shows a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with an initially fast and then slowed growth rate. Built-up land is the main carbon source, and its CO2 equivalent emissions increased by 26.78 million tons, while the forest is the main carbon sink, and its carbon absorption decreased by 4.11 x 10(4) tons. (3) The carbon sink areas are mainly located in Zhangjiajie and Xiangxi in western Hunan, and the CO2 equivalent emission intensity of other carbon source areas is gradually increasing from eastern Hunan to southern Hunan. (4) The carbon compensation value is very similar to the spatial distribution of CO2 equivalent emissions in different cities. The high carbon compensation areas are mainly Yueyang, Loudi, and Xiangtan due to their backward energy structure, un-upgraded industrial structure, and large net CO2 equivalent emissions, while the high carbon compensation areas are mainly Changsha, due to its high economic development level, great technological progress, and small net CO2 equivalent emissions. To achieve regional coordination and low-carbon development, it is necessary to continually improve the carbon compensation mechanism and to build on carbon compensation to promote regional low-carbon coordinated development from a low-carbon level. Meanwhile, the government should rank and direct the transformation and development of different types of cities, to build a low-carbon land development model and achieve the goal of developing carbon neutrality.

AB Ice energy storage systems (ICES) can be a promising technology for the combined provision of heating and cooling for non-residential buildings by utilizing currently unexploited waste heat without depending on solar assistance. However, detailed studies on the effects of different operating strategies of an ICES in the context of an overall supply system are not available yet, nor are there any design routines for dimensioning and inte-gration. For this purpose, a detailed numerical investigation and evaluation of an ICES in the supply system of a research building is performed in this work, using one-year measurement data of the system containing 500 m3 storage. The considered building, of which about 70 % of the floor area is disposed of for laboratories and workplaces, is located in Bayreuth, Germany, where a warm and moderate climate with an annual average temperature of 8.9 degrees C is prevailing. Thereby, both an optimization of plant operation and dimensioning is carried out, while frameworks of Germany, France and EU27 average are used to elaborate their influence on the optimization process. Compared to conventional heating and cooling, the existing system can reduce CO2 emissions by 37 % in optimal operation. Through the technically possible operating modes of the realized system, there is a range in annual costs from 213 to 287 keuro and CO2 emissions from 148 to 235 t/a between the optimal and worst control. By adapting the plant concept and a downhill simplex method for identifying optimal storage dimensioning, the economic efficiency of the process can also be significantly increased. Moreover, the config-uration of the optimal ICES realization shows a high dependency on the prevailing boundary conditions. For all considered regions, the use of ICES can lead to an ecological improvement as well as a reduction in demand-related costs, whereby the methodology can also be applicable to other building types in the future.

AB Cities are currently responsible for an important part of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, justifying the need to develop measures to help them become more sustainable. One of those measures can be to address under-utilized assets in cities, such as derelict buildings with high potential for rehabilitation, and the establishment of new residence hubs within cities. Consequently, this work establishes a novel framework for evaluating the impact of rehabilitating these buildings in an urban area in Lisbon, considering the energy consumption associated with the usage of the dwelling as well as the impact on mobility, since it was considered that these buildings will be occupied by people who currently work nearby but live in the outskirts of Lisbon, favouring an urban planning of proximity between home and work. To this extent, a methodology was developed for selecting the buildings to be analysed and the commuting movements to be replaced. Then, buildings were simulated in an urban building energy modelling (UBEM) tool, considering three rehabilitation scenarios, and the required primary energy, CO2 emissions, and costs were calculated. Regarding mobility, three new scenarios were compared with the current scenario. The results obtained confirm the high potential savings from the rehabilitation of derelict buildings and in the best-case scenario-corresponding to the rehabilitation considering envelope insulation, the installation of efficient windows, and the adoption of a heat pump together with a mobility standard targeting 15 min cities-reductions of 76% in primary energy and 84% in CO2 emissions were achieved.

AB This study investigates the possibility of creating an artificial intelligence system in the form of a predictive model that can recommend the foremost building heating system and their optimum performances for a building based on desired life cycle costs by the project manager and the permitted CO2 emission rate. Accordingly, the developed intelligent system would be able to recommend the most appropriate heating system when the building specifications are given to the system. Therefore, experts' knowledge can be substituted to recommend the foremost heating systems for a building. In this framework, a database is produced using a Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) for the buildings with various numbers of floors, built areas, and the number of residents. Pareto front data for each building is fitted with a curve, and the coefficients of the curves are given to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to create a predictive model for optimum performances. Moreover, all optimization data are assigned to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the classification lines be-tween different heating systems with the lowest risk. The coefficients of separator lines are given to another multi-layer perceptron to create the predictive model for available HVAC systems. The models' performance was improved by evaluating different structures for the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and implementing single -objective models instead of multi-objective ones. The proposed models' performance is acceptable considering the requirements of ASHRAE guideline 14.

AB Severe spatiotemporal heterogeneity of emissions sources and limited measurement networks have been hampering the monitoring and understanding of CO2 fluxes in large cities, a great concern in climate research as big cities are among the major sources of anthropogenic CO2 in the climate system. To understand the CO2 fluxes in Seoul, Korea, CO2 fluxes at eight surface energy balance sites, six urban (vegetation-area fraction < 15%) and two suburban (vegetation-area fraction > 60%), for 2017-2018 are analyzed and attributed to the local land-use and business types. The analyses show that the CO2 flux variations at the suburban sites are mainly driven by vegetation and that the CO2 flux differences between the urban and suburban sites originate from the differences in the vegetation-area fraction and anthropogenic CO2 emissions. For the CO2 fluxes at the urban sites; (1) vehicle traffic (traffic) and heating-fuel consumption (heating) contribute > 80% to the total, (2) vegetation effects are minimal, (3) the seasonal cycle is driven mainly by heating, (4) the contribution of heating is positively related to the building-area fraction, (5) the annual total is positively (negatively) correlated with the commercial-area (residential-area) fraction, and (6) the traffic at the commercial sites depend further on the main business types to induce distinct CO2 flux weekly cycles. This study shows that understanding and estimation of CO2 fluxes in large urban areas require careful site selections and analyses based on detailed consideration of the land-use and business types refined beyond the single representative land-use type widely-used in contemporary studies.

AB The main purpose of this study is to understand the energy consumption profiles of different building types by identifying and comparing their energy consumption parameters with their sensitivities to each other while indicating the long-term energy consumption implications on energy cost and CO2 emissions. A duplex house, apartment building, convention center, and school building were selected to develop dynamic simulation models for the investigation. The annual electric and gas demand of buildings were calculated and compared based on their energy usage intensity (kWh/m(2)), emission intensity (kg CO2/m(2)), and cost intensity (USD/m(2)) with their sensitivity to selected parameters. Further, the 50-year longevity of the buildings that include the selected materials' production and demolition stages were included to estimate the lifetime. Also, retrofitting strategies including renewable technology integration were developed for each building type separately based on their energy concerns. The average energy consumption of parameters from highest to lowest are space heating, area lights, equipment, space cooling, hot water, fans, and pumps, respectively. The critical primary energy consumption of the educational building and convention center is 43% and 38% from equipment and 30% from space heating for residential buildings. A large portion of the emission is allocated to energy consumption during the lifetime of buildings, mainly due to electricity consumption. The energy costs mainly are also electricity related. Although the effects of retrofit strategies are different depending on the energy behavior of buildings, the most effective scenario is envelope retrofitting, followed by lighting improvement.

AB Carbon emissions increase the risk of climate change. As one of the primary sources of carbon emissions, road traffic faces a significant challenge in terms of reducing carbon emissions. Many studies have been conducted to examine the impacts of cities on carbon emissions from the perspectives of urbanization, population size, and economics. However, a detailed understanding of the relationship between road traffic and urban carbon emissions is lacking due to the lack of a reasonable set of road traffic metrics. Furthermore, there have been fewer studies that have conducted cluster analyses of the impact factors, which will be supplemented in this research. We established 10 impact metrics, including the highway network system, city road network system, public transit system, and land use system of streets and transportation, using 117 county-level cities in Hebei Province as the study area, which is one of the regions in China with the most acute conflicts between economic development and the environment. We built an ordinary least squares (OLS) model, a spatial lag model (SLM), a spatial error model (SEM), a spatial Durbin model (SDM), and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, and performed a cluster analysis on the key metrics. The results are as follows: (1) The difference in spatial distribution of urban land-average carbon emissions is obvious, highly concentrated in the areas surrounding Beijing and Tianjin. (2) The GWR model has a higher R-2 and a lower AICc than global models (OLS, SLM, SEM, and SDM) and performs better when analyzing the impact mechanism. (3) Highway network density, city road length, and density of the public transit network have significant effects on urban land-average carbon emissions, whereas the street and transportation land use systems have no significant effect, which indicates that the highway network and public transit systems should be prioritized. (4) The GWR model results show that the impact of the four metrics on the urban land-average carbon emissions exhibits clear spatial heterogeneity with a significant piecewise spatial distribution pattern. The highway network density has a relatively large impact on the northern region. The northwest is more affected by the density of the public transit network. The southwest is most impacted by the length of city roads. (5) The study area is divided into four distinct characteristic areas: the highway network dominant impact area, the public transit dominant impact area, the city road network dominant impact area, and the multi-factor joint impact area. Different traffic optimization strategies are proposed for different areas.

AB The new European targets of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 have spurred Italy to aim for a 30% reduction in emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. This goal will be achieved through the promotion of renewable energy sources and energy savings in the residential sector, which remains one of the main sectors accountable for total energy consumption, mainly for heating. This study aims at investigating the potential of some retrofit measures implemented in the Umbria Region, chosen as a case study, to reach the goal by 2030. Using parametric energy simulations with the standard calculation method and artificial neural networks (ANN), the energy consumption of Umbria's building stock and potential CO2 reductions were assessed. Results showed that with current energy policies, a reduction of 28% could be achieved, which is below the goal by 2030, while ANN integration within energy strategies could allow reaching it as early as 2025 or 2029, depending on the restriction set to the ANN and the extent of current energy policies. This study confirmed the potential benefits of using advanced technology in achieving national environmental goals, highlighting that they could be essential tools to be integrated into energy policies to accelerate progress towards ambitious climate goals.

AB Characteristics of CO2 emissions generated by electricity are analysed to provide a basis for formulating CO2-reduction policies in power systems. Using a case study in Anhui Province, China for 2010-2019, the influence of factors driving CO2 emissions is quantified by means of the logarithmic mean Divisia index method.
   As the proportion of electricity in final energy consumption gradually increases, CO2 emissions reduction actions in the power system will become the key to achieving China's carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality goals. It is essential to analyse and quantify the driving forces of CO2 emissions from electricity generation in the fossil-rich area in China. This paper aims to identify the characteristics of CO2 emissions generated by electricity and provide a basis for formulating CO2-reduction policies in power systems. First, we analyse the current state of CO2 emissions from electricity generation in Anhui Province that was dominated by fossil energy during the period 2010-19. Then, we apply the logarithmic mean Divisia index method to find the nature of the factors influencing the changes in CO2 emissions. Finally, we analyse the CO2-reduction measures of each side of the source-network-load-storage of the power system in Anhui through a power-system carbon-reduction path analysis model proposed in this study and provide policy suggestions. The results showed the following. (i) CO2 emissions in Anhui Province continued to increase from 2010 to 2019 and the trend in the growth rate of CO2 emissions presented approximately a u-shaped curve. (ii) Economic activity has always been the dominant factor driving the growth of electricity CO2 emissions. The increase in the proportion of renewable energy in power generation, the improvement in thermal power-conversion efficiency and the decrease in the intensity of power consumption are the three major driving factors for the reduction in CO2 emissions from power generation in Anhui. (iii) The CO2-reduction measures of the power system are provided in each link of the source-network-load-storage, such as developing the photovoltaic industry and building energy storage, upgrading and transforming coal-fired power stations, reducing the loss rate of transmission lines on the grid side and improving the efficiency of the utilization of electricity on the user side.

AB The ultra-low energy building is an effective solution to reduce building energy consumption and CO2 emission in high-cold and high-altitude areas of China. A new ultra-low energy building in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was built, and a solar-air source heat pump system was designed to cover the heating needs in winter. The performance of the ultra-low energy building was studied by measurement and simulation methods. The measured results show that the average room temperature is above 18 degrees C without heating, and the indoor temperature can meet the requirements of 20 degrees C with the heating system. The indoor VOC concentration can be maintained at a low level. The building's air tightness can meet the requirements of the ultra-low energy building. The heating system ran well, and the average COP was 2.6. The simulation results show that the natural room temperature is between 20 and 23 degrees C more than 90% of the time under heating conditions. The average COP of the heat pump is 3.6, and the solar energy guarantee rate is 44.8% throughout the heating season. The heating system can save 2490.5 kg of standard coal and 6724.3 kg of CO2 emission per year.

AB Building is an important scenario for achieving global carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals, accounting for approximately 37% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2020. In the meanwhile, the construction and operation of buildings was responsible for 36% of global energy consumption, of which 30% energy was used for space heating. Therefore, this paper proposes a low-carbon building heating system that is coupled to a new semiconductor radiation heating unit and distributed rooftop photovoltaic to reduce carbon emissions. To reveal its building heating characteristics, a dynamic model of heat transfer based on semiconductor low-temperature radiant heating is first established by analyzing the heat conduction, convection, and radiation models, and the uncertainty from both the distributed rooftop photovoltaic and building heating demand is considered in the building heating operation strategy. Then, a simulation model of a low-carbon building heating system is built in MATLAB/SIMULINK for two different climate zones in China (Beijing and Wuhan). When building and using the low-carbon building heating system stable for 30 years, the payback period is 5.2-8.2 years in Beijing and 6.4-11.6 years in Wuhan. Compared with the traditional grid-powered heating system, the simulation revealed that the carbon emissions of Beijing and Wuhan during the heating season are reduced by 44.9% and 44.3%, respectively, and the corresponding building heating cost is saved by 62.1% and 57.8%.

AB The objective of this article is to compare the behaviour of the most representative domestic hot water systems (DHW) in single-family buildings. The study evaluates the energy consumption, equivalent CO2 emissions and cost for each system over a 15-year life period. This analysis is carried out in four cli- matic zones across Europe to observe the influence of climatic conditions on the results. The four climatic zones are located in the cities of Athens, Madrid, London and Berlin. The analysed systems are: a) natural gas-fired instantaneous water heaters, b) electric storage water heater, c) solar thermal system with gas- fired instantaneous, d) solar thermal system with electric storage water heater, e) air-source heat pump, f) photovoltaic system with electric storage water heater, and g) photovoltaic system with air-source heat pump. This range of technologies covers the most likely solutions to be implemented across domestic buildings in Europe.The heat pump system (HPWH) with PV considering self-consumption shows the lowest environmen- tal impact in all zones, but is not an attractive investment in the coldest zones due to lower natural gas prices. Thermal solar systems have a high purchase and maintenance costs which do not compensate their energy savings. The PV HPWH system has a greater reduction of emissions and a lower cost than HPWH across a 15-year life. The gas boiler system has the lowest cost in a 15-year period in the coldest areas, despite having a greater environmental impact than the heat pump.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban travel is a major component of urban transport, and the total carbon emissions of urban transport can be effectively reduced if the carbon emissions of residents' travel can be reasonably controlled. Based on the questionnaire data of many different types of residential areas in Guangzhou, the daily travel behaviour of residents was analysed and their travel carbon emissions were calculated. The differences in travel characteristics and travel carbon emissions of residents in different types of residential areas were compared. The influencing factors of residents' travel carbon emissions were divided into three categories: individual socio-economic factors, built environment, and residents' travel behaviour. On this basis, a structural equation model is established to study the impact mechanism of residents' travel carbon emissions. The path relationship between endogenous variables and endogenous variables, as well as the path relationship between exogenous variables and endogenous variables were investigated. The interactions between various influencing factors of residents' travel carbon emissions were examined. The results show that: (1) there are significant differences in residents' travel carbon emissions in different types of municipalities. Residents' travel carbon emissions in Guangzhou are closer to the 60/20 distribution; (2) compared with individual socio-economic factors, the impact of the built environment on travel carbon emissions is more obvious; (3) travel distance and travel mode are the factors that directly affect residents' travel carbon emissions. Proposals have been made to reduce the carbon emissions of residents travelling.

AB Energy, which has an important position both in the world and in Turkiye, is essential for many primary areas, such as heating-cooling and production. After the industrial revolution, replacing simple machines with steam engines started the adventure of energy dependence and gave strategic energy importance. This situation has played a critical role in reshaping human history. In addition, due to the limited fossil energy resources and the continuous increase in energy costs, countries have started to develop new energy policies for their interests. Thus, scientists have accelerated their work in the field of energy efficiency. District heating systems, one of the best examples of renewable energy use, are the main subject of this study. District heating can be defined as the heating of a building, neighborhood, or city with power plants installed in one or more centers. This study aims to calculate the financial benefit of the district heating systems to be created with the use of geothermal resources in Turkiye to the Turkiye economy and its contribution to the goals of carbon neutrality. As a result of the use of a geothermal-sourced district heating system, a 1.58% reduction will be achieved in Turkiye's annual greenhouse gas emissions. With current investment amounts, the amortization period of 1,000,000 residential equivalent geothermal sourced district heating system implementation is approximately 13 years. Numerical methods were used in this study.

ID POLICY
AB Reducing carbon emissions is the top priority for mankind for dealing with climate issues. The Chinese government selected 30 demonstration cities in three batches and provided these cities green special transfer payment funds for three years to build green projects and achieve energy saving and emission reduction (ESER). This policy provides a great opportunity to study whether green transfer payments play an important role in carbon reduction, which has received little attention before. Additionally, the central government set a series of fiscal performance assessment indicators, including the ESER effect, the completion of green projects, and long-term mechanism construction in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of funds. This article creatively conducts theoretical analysis from the perspective of performance assessment, takes ESER special transfer payment policy as a quasi-natural experiment, and uses the panel data of 284 cities in China from 2007 to 2017 and 2019 to verify the impact of the green transfer payment on carbon emissions in and after demonstration periods and its mechanisms with the staggered DID method and the new DID Multiplegt (DIDM) model. This article found that green transfer payments could reduce carbon emissions in demonstration cities, and this effect still existed even after policy withdrawal. Mechanism analysis further corroborates that the carbon-reduction effect of green transfer payments could be achieved by increasing the urban green area and improving energy efficiency. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that green transfers have a greater carbon reduction effect on demonstration cities, which receives more green transfer payment funds and has a higher level of financial development. Recommendations related to setting proper performance assessment ESER indicators include improving the management of ESER transfer funds and maximizing the cost-benefit ratio of fiscal funds, which are proposed according to the research conclusions.

AB The built environment sector causes significant climate change impacts, which indicates an opportunity for the sector to be of great importance in reducing its global impact. The main strategy has focused on urban density and transport as well as studying the emissions caused by buildings with life-cycle assessments (LCAs). However, a holistic approach is often missing, where life-cycle environmental impacts are assessed, and goals are considered at the planning stage. This study proposes LCA on a neighborhood scale for a holistic approach and to identify how LCA can be used to reduce impacts when designing and for decision-making at the planning stage. The focus is on the pre-use phase because that phase has been proven to cause a significant spike in carbon emissions when considering the near future and is crucial in reaching climate goals. The study case is a new neighborhood plan in Reykjavik, Iceland. The assessment focuses on the climate change impact of building a new neighborhood. The study identifies materials as a key factor. It demonstrates how the total emissions of the neighborhood are reduced when more environmentally friendly materials are replaced by traditional ones. It reduces GHG emissions by up to 40% in total.

AB Research on carbon emission is an important basis for solving global climate problems, and it is also one of the ways to quantitatively assess the impact of human activities. Cities are one of the main bearing spaces of human activities, and reasonable urban form is conducive to reducing energy consumption in human activities. This paper takes 50 clusters within Zhuhai, China, as the research object, quantifies the landscape spatial form index and social spatial form index of each cluster and establishes the index set of urban spatial form, so as to analyze the influence of different urban spatial form index on carbon emission. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) From the spatial distribution of each index, the urban cluster size and residential building area of each cluster in Zhuhai are generally large, and the distribution is basically consistent with that of densely populated areas. The urban clusters with high dominance are mainly located in the main urban area of Xiangzhou District, and the urban compactness, dispersion and industrial building area are generally high in the west and low in the east. (2) The size of urban clusters, industrial building area and residential building area have a strong promoting effect on carbon emission, while the compactness, dispersion and dominance of urban clusters have a strong inhibiting effect on carbon emission. (3) Based on the above conclusions, the low-carbon urban spatial form optimization strategy should be proposed from three aspects: urban development boundary control, promoting industrial structure transformation and compact urban development.

AB With the gradual maturity of wind power technology, China's wind power generation has grown rapidly over the recent years. However, due to the on-site inconsumable electricity, the phenomenon of large-scale "wind curtailment" occurs in some areas. In this paper, a novel hybrid hydrogen/electricity refueling station is built near a wind farm, and a part of the surplus wind power is used to charge electric trucks, and the other part of the surplus power is used to produce "green hydrogen". According to real-time load changes, different amounts of liquid hydrogen and gas hydrogen can be properly coordinated to provide timely energy supply for hydrogen trucks. For a 400 MW wind farm in the western Inner Mongolia, China, the feasibility of the proposed system has been carried out based on the sensitivity and reliability analysis, the static and dynamic economic modeling, with an entire life cycle analysis. Compared to the conventional technology, the initial investment of the proposed scheme (700.07 M$) decreases by 13.97%, and the dynamic payback period (10.93 years) decreases by 25.87%. During the life cycle of the proposed system, the accumulative NPV reaches 184.63 M$, which increases by 3.14 times compared to the case by conventional wind technology.

AB Building energy efficiency is a key factor in reducing CO2 emissions. For this reason, European Union (EU) member states have developed thermal regulations to ensure building thermal performance. These results are often based on results achieved with building simulation software during the design stage. However, the actual thermal performance can deviate significantly from the predicted one, and this difference is known as the energy performance gap. Accurate indicators of the actual thermal performance are a valuable tool to guarantee building quality. These indicators, including the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and the heat loss coefficient (HLC), can be estimated by the application of in situ methods. As multi-family housing and tertiary sector buildings are an important part of the building stock, mature methods to measure their thermal performance are needed. This paper presents a short-duration method for assessing the HTC in large building typologies using a sampling approach. The method was applied in a four-storey building model under different conditions to study the limits of the method and to improve indicator bias and uncertainty. Indicator quality was strongly influenced by the external weather conditions, the temperature variation during the protocol and the heat exchange with the adjacent apartments. Under winter conditions and with stable indoor temperatures, the method had a high accuracy when the protocol was applied for half a day. It is recommended that the protocol be used over two days to improve indicator quality under less favorable test conditions.

ID RESOURCE BASE; EVOLUTION; ENERGY; ENGLAND; HELSBY
AB Deep geothermal energy can aid in the decarbonization of heat within the UK; this is required to meet net zero carbon emissions targets by 2050. The Cheshire Basin represents a significant opportunity for the development of deep geothermal resources; there are vast quantities of high permeability sandstones in hydraulic continuity, with temperatures favorable for direct heat use and, potentially, for power generation. Newly produced basal temperature maps in this study indicate the likely maximum temperatures for the basin, with the hottest temperature expected to be between 100 and 131.2 degrees C in the Crewe area. There have also previously been a range of estimates highlighting a geothermal resource within the basin to be in the region of 44.1 to 75 x 10(18) J; however, previous estimates for heat in place are limited to simple volumetric or geometrical constraints. Therefore, this paper uses digitized depth and temperature maps to provide new estimates for the heat in place. Results suggest the resource has been underestimated and there is a need for more detailed evaluation. Depending on the geothermal gradient, the resource could be between 91 and 144 x 10(18) J (1.26 to 1.45 x 10(17) J/km(2)). Although there is a significant amount of heat in place, geological issues preventing development remain, such as the uncertainty in the quality of the reservoir at depth due to data limitations and the lateral continuity of the Manchester Marls Formation, which could act as a barrier to flow. Nevertheless, further regional assessment of the basin and data acquisition is required to build confidence in the reservoir quality and reduce uncertainty. This could unlock the basin for geothermal development.

AB With the acceleration of China's urbanization process, the importance of energy conservation and emission reduction in the building sector has become increasingly prominent. The effective control of carbon emissions in coastal provinces has a decisive impact on achieving the carbon emissions peak target nationwide. Based on the analysis of the influencing factors, this study establishes an urban residential buildings carbon emission prediction model by combining the IPAT model and the ridge regression model. In addition, the prediction model is combined with scenario analysis to simulate the evolution of carbon emission trends of urban residential buildings in Fujian Province from 2018 to 2050 under different scenarios. The results show that total population, urban living area, residents' consumption expenditure, urbanization rate, per capita GDP, and energy structure are key factors affecting carbon emissions from urban residential buildings in coastal cities. Only under the ultra-low carbon model scenario can Fujian's urban residential buildings achieve the carbon peak goal in 2027 (13.4748 million tons of CO2), which requires a reduction of 59.67% compared to that under the baseline model scenario. This study can provide an effective reference for energy conservation and emission reduction work of the regional scale and even the national scale.

   efficiency; heating and cooling; office buildings
AB The traditional sequential design of building elements, where every element performs only one dedicated function, carries significant embodied energy. Thus, modular pre-fabricated load-bearing elements could overcome the disadvantages of the current carbon-intensive construction practice and go beyond; as such, lightweight glass fiber-polymer composite profiles could be more advantageous in performance. Cellular structures of such profiles can be advantageous for adding water channels for active heating and cooling indoors and for fire protection. Therefore, the development of such a modular active building slab referred to as P-TACS (Prefabricated Thermally-Activated Fiber-Polymer Composite Slab) is explored in this work. The structural performance of a proposed P-TACS design is verified in terms of serviceability and ultimate limit states. The addition of local carbon fiber inclusions allows for an increase in the span of the slab to 10 m and a more uniform surface temperature. Thermal performance of the structurally optimized geometrical configuration is analyzed by, first of all, determining water parameters based on the 1D approach partially adopted from the standard radiant systems analysis and, secondly, by a detailed 2D thermal analysis using ANSYS Fluent numerical simulations. The hydraulic and thermal performance comparison of the novel P-TACS design with two standard radiant systems (ESS Type A and RCP) reveals that the P-TACS design outperforms the standard embedded surface system ESS Type A, both for floor heating and cooling case. In addition, the response time of P-TACS is three times faster compared to the ESS response time. The main advantage of the P-TACS is in lower mean water temperature, compared to traditional embedded radiant systems (e.g., EES type), required for conditioning the space, potentially resulting in lower operational energy use. The fire outbreak scenario is considered to complete the analysis, and the measures to switch water flow from nominal to fire scenario are proposed.

AB China's carbon emissions and smog have become increasingly problematic, with ecological environment pollution becoming an unavoidable consequence of urban and economic development. Residential areas are particularly important for creating a healthy and livable environment. This study aims to improve the internal environmental quality of residential areas from the perspective of urban design. After selecting synergistic effect indicators and model algorithms, the CO2 emissions of building energy consumption in residential areas in Xi'an and PM2.5 are measured. Using Stata data analysis software, the model parameter results are compared. The results reveal that the CO2 emissions and PM2.5 concentrations of different underlying surfaces in residential areas is positively synergistic, and the space of hard underlying surfaces is more synergistic than that of green space. Temperature is the most important influencing factor of PM2.5 concentration, the elastic coefficient reaches 16.682%, and the plot ratio is the most important CO2 emission influencing factor. Further, the coef-ficient of elasticity reached 929.458. The positive synergistic growth of CO2 emissions and PM2.5 concentration in residential areas was further verified through the evaluation index of quantifying the synergy effect. The findings provide a scientific basis for formulating urban construction policies for future carbon and haze reduction, and residential environment quantification.

AB The aim of the paper is to quantify the construction production carbon footprint per m3 of the built-up volume of the building. In order to determine the carbon footprint, 5 typical detached houses were selected. The individual buildings have the same material -construction characteristics; however, they differ in the size of the built-up volume, i.e. also in the built-up area. The LCA software was used to quantify the carbon footprint during the production phase of the model houses project. A budget indicator per m3 of the built-up volume was determined based on these calculations.

AB To combat climate change and meet energy conservation and emission reduction goals, the building sector must adopt low-carbon technologies and low-carbon management methods. To systematically explore existing research areas and track future research trends of carbon emission in the construction stage (CECS), this study conducts a bibliometric and content analysis of CECS studies. 563 relevant publications published between 2000 and 2022 are examined and analyzed using data from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database. The findings reveal that studies of CECS have evolved through three stages: preliminary exploratory period, stable development period, and rapid development period. In addition, the literature co-citation network and content analysis classify the 13 found co-citation clusters into four knowledge domains: sources definition, data statistics, assessment methods, and carbon reduction strategies. Finally, a knowledge map of CECS studies is presented, outlining significant aspects of research, existing gaps in knowledge, and directions for future study. This work will make it easier for academics and professionals to pinpoint promising areas of study, fill in knowledge gaps, and broaden the scope of existing research on CECS.

AB Despite the considerable breakthrough in district heating systems (DHS) globally, there is not yet any policy on developing this technology in Iran. This country has a high range of energy demand, while renewable energies play a minor role in its energy supply chain. Furthermore, the world is going through a transition towards renewable resources, which currently consist of only 10% of the total energy mix. As the first contribution in this area, this paper aims to design a 100% renewable DHS integrated with radiant floor heating for a group of residential buildings in Sarein, Iran. Moreover, the literature proposes a novel approach for combining geothermal energy and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) to achieve a 100% renewable energy system. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is used for thermal analysis by 3D designing the buildings in SketchUp and OpenStudio and simulating the heat load in EnergyPlus. Three scenarios are presented to better compare the DHS with the decentralized heating system regarding fuel consumption, as well as environmental and economic aspects. The town's existing heating system that consumes natural gas for both space heating and hot water demand is referred to as the IHS-G scenario. The DHS-G scenario represents an 87% renewable DHS system, working with natural gas and geothermal energy, while the DHS-MSW scenario is a 100% renewable system, consuming both geothermal energy and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). Finally, findings suggest that DHS-MSW and DHS-G scenarios reduce the annual energy consumption of buildings by about 595 and 33 toes, respectively. Hence, the greenhouse gas effect will alleviate by mitigating the emission of 1403 and 1339 tons of CO2-eq./year, respectively. Moreover, exporting the extra natural gas through both LNG and pipeline provides about 26 million and 28 million USD/year revenue in DHS-G and DHS-MSW scenarios.

AB Recent evidence available in the literature has highlighted that the high-energy consumption rate associated with air conditioning leads to the undesired "overcooling" condition in arid-climate regions. To this end, this study quantified the effects of increasing the cooling setpoint temperature on reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions to mitigate overcooling. DesignBuilder software was used to simulate the performance of a generic building operating under the currently adopted ASHRAE HVAC criteria. It was found that increasing the cooling setpoint temperature by 1 degrees C will increase the operative temperature by approximately 0.25 degrees C and reduce the annual cooling electricity consumption required for each 1 m(2) of an occupied area by approximately 8 kWh/year. This accounts for a reduction of 8% in cooling energy consumption compared to the ASHRAE cooling setpoint (i.e., t_s = 26 degrees C) and a reduction in the annual CO2 emission rate to roughly 4.8 kg/m(2) degrees C. The largest reduction in cooling energy consumption and CO2 emissions was found to occur in October, with reduced rates of approximately-1.3 kWh/m(2) degrees C and -0.8 kg/m(2) degrees C, respectively.

AB Cities consume a large amount of energy and discharge massive greenhouse gas emissions, which are key areas supporting low-carbon development and combating the global warming crisis. Conducting regional impact as-sessments has been a trending research topic, but not without its challenges; especially, foreground data acquisition and temporal dynamics consideration. This study integrates City Information Modeling (CIM) and Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment (DLCA) to develop a new regional carbon impact assessment model, including five parts: goal and scope definition, CIM module, foreground elementary flows analysis, dynamic assessment, and interpretation. In the integration model, CIM is used to extract the geometric and semantic data of the physical elements and geospatial information of built environment. Temporal variations in foreground elementary flows, background inventory datasets, characterization factors, and weighting factors were quantified and involved. A university campus was used to verify the CIM-DLCA integration model, and the impact results were visualized and analyzed from temporal and spatial dynamic perspectives. The influences and sensitivity of dynamic factors were quantified and compared. In addition, the uncertainty issues, data acquisition advantages, and CIM-DLCA integration strategies were discussed. Some valuable future research directions were proposed. This study takes an exploratory step and demonstrates that combining CIM with DLCA is both feasible and operable. This provides a theoretical foundation for intelligent assessment and can be used to promote low -carbon city management.

ID LEVELIZED COST; CONSUMPTION; ATRIUM
AB In the tourism industry, hotels and homestay facilities account for considerable amounts of energy con-sumption and CO2 emissions. Unlike other types of buildings, occupancy has significant fluctuations over time, while mostly being ignored or using a simple assumption based on energy use intensity or setting the occupancy levels. Due to the lack of occupancy rate information, great uncertainties exist in hotel operations, which leads to erroneous estimates of energy consumption in existing hotel buildings. This paper examines hotel operation practices in China with real occupancy rate data which is critical for reducing the uncertainty of estimating energy consumption patterns. Specifically, this study proposes a two-stage comprehensive and quantitative performance assessment approach for the homestay hotel building considering the system's energy and economic performance simultaneously. Regarding energy performance, there are two key facets to consider: renewable energy penetration and grid impact perfor-mance. Additionally, the economic performance (annual income and extra annual investment) of various energy portfolios is evaluated using break-even analysis. The impacts of large fluctuation in occupancy rate on electrical loads are considered and assessed in typical homestay hotels. The proposed assessment approach can comprehensively quantify the impacts of the photovoltaics (PV) areas and battery capaci-ties on the system performance in terms of energy and economics. According to the results of the occupancy-based assessment, the ideal PV area and battery capacity are 400 m2 and 16 kWh, respec-tively, as opposed to the optimal energy portfolios (PV area 600 m2 and battery capacity 24 kWh) deter-mined from conventional assessment results.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Decarbonizing residential buildings with heat pumps: Transferability of
   front-runner experiences from Swiss Cantons

DT Article
DE Energy policy; Climate targets; Decarbonization
AB The replacement of fossil-fuelled heating systems with systems using renewable energy sources is a central energy and climate policy concern and one of the prerequisites for reducing CO2 emissions to a climate-friendly level. The Swiss decarbonization strategy considers the use of electric air-to-water heat pumps (HP) operated with electricity generated from renewable sources or from a power mix with low CO2 content. However, the installation of HPs, which is essential for decarbonizing heat supply in buildings, is proceeding very slowly, and fossil fuel heating replacement is still the rule rather than the exception. This study investigates how a strong climate protection law (Energy Act of Basel-Stadt) has managed to overcome resistance to the installation of HPs, which is observed in many other Swiss cantons. The research question to be answered is whether the experience made with HP implementation in one location (with Basel-Stadt as forerunner canton) would be similarly viable in another location (Canton of Geneva). The results indicate that although the two cantons have different characteristics in terms of building stock, the potential of buildings where HP installation is considered 'easy' is high in both cases (50% in Basel-Stadt and 40% in Geneva). This is equivalent to 40% (in both cities) of the energy used for thermal use that is currently produced by fossil energy and that could be instead generated with HPs. Although there are many factors to take into account in order to design effective policies that are truly effective for the extensive installation of HP, it is worth remembering that there are many cases where it is already possible to easily install a HP today, and these should be the starting point.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Optimization of insulation layer thickness is a significant factor in energy-efficient building design. Accurate determination of the thickness of the insulation layer will contribute to building energy conservation. In this study, ten typical cities in five thermal zones were selected, and the external thermal insulation of a typical residential building was taken as the research object. Using the degree day method and the economic model of full life cycle cost analysis, the optimal thickness of seven kinds of building insulation materials under absolute dry conditions, the lowest humidity and the highest humidity of the monthly average of the annual daily average were obtained. In addition, the carbon emission, energy saving and recovery period of materials under different working conditions were further obtained through numerical calculation. The results show that the optimum thickness of seven building insulation materials in ten typical cities under three working conditions is 18.21-346.05 mm. Their carbon emission change rate is between -2.7% and 38.6%, energy saving change rate is between -0.4% and 18.4%, and the payback period growth is within 1.5 years. Among them, polystyrene foam is the material least affected by humidity. It is recommended to be the main building insulation material in high humidity areas.

AB In Northern Italy, woody biomass is widely used as an energy carrier for domestic heating systems; this leads to lower CO2 emissions, but some concerns are due to particulate matter emissions. The present paper compares three methodological approaches to estimate biomass consumption for residential heating in the Italian Po Valley using data aggregation and dynamic simulations. The first deals with the recent sample survey carried out within the LIFE + PREPAIR project, which quantifies the number and age of biomass appliances and estimates their consumption. The second approach consists of indirect estimation of biomass consumption based on reference buildings' dynamic simulations combined with data mining derived by institutional bodies. The third approach is a direct energy calculation which estimates the consumption starting from the biomass appliances stock. The different approaches have shown a good consistency with an estimated annual biomass consumption in the Po Valley ranging between 89 PJ and 95 PJ, corresponding to 15 % of the total fuel consumption. Part of this energy (14 %) is produced by the combustion of pellets (about 1 Mt) and the remaining part corresponds to the com-bustion of wood logs (about 5.5 Mt). These results show that, based on available information, multiple ap-proaches to estimate residential biomass consumption can be adopted; applying the model to different years and case studies is desirable. This estimation is necessary as an input to air emission evaluation and, therefore, to support policy makers in implementing and monitoring effective air quality measures to reduce air pollution in the Po Valley.

AB One of the pillars of the policies undertaken to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 in the European Union is the decarbonisation of the construction sector. Massive energy renovation of existing buildings is expected in the coming years and encouraged by supporting incentives. A considerable amount of resources will be invested in this area and the large-scale interventions will be conveyed by Energy Service Companies that usually employ Energy Performance Contracts for the implementation of the restructuring interventions. This form of contract is generally bound to the achievement of a certain level of energy performance, which ensures an adequate profit margin for the Energy Service Company and the users subscribing the contract. But how reliable is the forecast of energy consumption and to what extent could it constitute a well-founded guarantee based on an Energy Performance Contract? The analysis proposed in this paper aims at investigating in this direction and proposes a design methodology based on Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis that can be validly applied to reduce the investment risk. A case study consisting of an Italian social housing complex is considered for energy, economic, and environmental evaluations. The results show that the Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis allows for identifying corrective measures at the design stage, making it possible to increase the chances of success of the intervention by 60%, raise the earning potential by 4% compared to the predictions, and obtain an additional reduction in CO2 emissions of 40%. This makes the investment more attractive and safe promoting the participation of Energy Service Companies in the renovation of the existing building stock.

AB The rapid development of the tertiary industry has made the energy consumption of public buildings grow too fast during the operation stage, which has become a key area of energy conservation and emission reduction in China's construction industry. This study uses the Minimum Distance to Strong effective Frontier function (MinDS) and Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) index analysis methods to measure the public building carbon emission efficiency (PBCEE) of 30 provincial-level units in China's eight economic regions from 2010 to 2019, and analyze regional differences and evolution. Then, the influencing factors of PBCEE in different regions were analyzed using the fixed-effect panel data model. The results show that: 1) China's PBCEE is generally low, with an average efficiency value of only 0.74, and there are great differences among regions, showing the spatial characteristics of "high in the east and low in the west. " 2) Relying on the positive impact of technological progress, the PBCEE in the eight regions increased year by year, with an annual growth rate of 1.82%. 3) The influence results and degrees of various factors on PBCEE are different in different economic zones, but increasing the proportion of electricity consumption has a certain positive effect on improving PBCEE. The same influencing factor has obvious threshold characteristics for PBCEE in different regions, so the government needs to consider the actual situation of the region when formulating carbon emission reduction policies for public buildings.

AB Urban densification increases the number of people living in urban areas and is hypothesized to be a more efficient use of available land than urban sprawl. The objective of this study was to quantify the operational and embodied emissions created as a result of densification. A 'Business as usual' and a 'Concentrated' densification strategy were investigated. When densifying at the neighbourhood level, existing buildings can either be replaced or extended to accommodate the additional inhabitants. The densification strategies were applied to two reference urban design neighbourhoods in Switzerland. The 'Typical' approach assumed that all the buildings were demolished and rebuilt and the 'Preserve-e xisting' approach involved the extension of existing buildings as much as possible. Construction material choice and modification of the built form were the sources of embodied emissions considered for each strategy. Urban building energy modelling was used to calculate the emissions incurred by heating the buildings and the embodied emissions were calculated using building standards. The operational perfor-mance was simulated assuming both a gas boiler and an electric heat pump to determine the influence of the heating system type on the operational emissions. This study found that savings of approximately 30% in embodied emissions can be achieved by extending the existing building stock rather than rebuild-ing. However, these savings represent a relatively small percentage of the total emissions incurred throughout a building's lifetime and the savings further diminish in the concentrated densification strategies.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB In this paper, the characteristics of the Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) green building certification system in terms of the scope of certification, and environmental and social strategies focused on 6024 units in the 17 EDGE-certified residential buildings in South Africa was investigated. This research analyzed the efficiency of energy, water, embodied energy in materials, and annual CO2 emissions and their contribution to solving housing issues in the given context. This research revealed that the design of EDGE-certified buildings focuses on the "efficiency first" approach and reduced energy and water demand more than on-site energy production. In energy-saving strategies, energy-saving solutions are three times (69.2%) higher than energy-generating solutions (23.1%). The results on resource savings showed that, on average, embodied energy in materials (54%) is the most reduced resource, followed by water (31%) and energy (29.7%). The statistical analysis indicated that there is no statistically significant correlation between energy, water, embodied energy in materials, and CO2 savings with floor areas of the buildings. In addition, this research highlighted how EDGE certification has positively contributed to solving South Africa's resource shortage and affordable housing scarcity problems.

AB The popularization and use of green buildings are of great significance for reducing the carbon emissions of buildings and achieving sustainable development. Scientific evaluation of the green building design scheme is the key factor in ensuring the popularization and use of green buildings. To overcome the shortage of a systematic evaluation index system and comprehensive evaluation method, an evaluation index system of green building design schemes and an evaluation method based on the projection pursuit model were developed. First, according to the needs of green building development, an evaluation index system of green building design schemes was systematically constructed from the five aspects of the economy, the resource utilization index, environmental impacts, technical management, and social impacts. The calculation methods of all secondary indexes are provided in detail. Then, a novel evaluation method based on the projection pursuit model optimized by the atomic orbital search was constructed. This method searches for key influencing factors and determines the evaluation grade from the evaluation data structure, and realizes the scientific and objective evaluations of green building design schemes. Finally, the Nanchang Hengda Project was selected to conduct a detailed empirical study. The research results show that the incremental net present value of the investment, the energy consumption of the air conditioning system, and the ratio of the window area to the indoor area are the most important secondary indexes. Moreover, the environmental impact index was found to be the most important primary index. Via comparisons with different optimization algorithms and evaluation methods, the superiority of the proposed model is proven.

AB High-quality data on building energy use and indoor pollution are critical to supporting government efforts to reduce carbon emissions and improve the population's health. This study describes the development of a city-representative housing stock model used for estimating space-cooling energy use and indoor PM2.5 exposure across the Hong Kong housing stock. Archetypes representative of Hong Kong dwellings were developed based on geographically-referenced housing databases. Simulations of unique combinations of archetype, occupation, and environment were run using EnergyPlus, estimating the annual space-cooling energy consumption and annual average PM2.5 exposure concentrations under both non-retrofit and retrofit scenarios. Results show that modern village houses and top-floor flats in high-rise residential buildings, on average, used 19% more space-cooling energy than other archetypes. Dwellings in urban areas had lower exposure to outdoor-sourced PM2.5 and higher exposure to indoor-sourced PM2.5 compared to those in rural areas. The percentage decrease in space-cooling energy consumption caused by energy efficiency retrofits, including external wall insulation, low-e windows, and airtightening, varied significantly based on archetype. The implementation of external wall insulation in the housing stock led to an average decrease of 3.5% in indoor PM2.5 exposure, whilst airtightening and low-e windows resulted in 7.9% and 0.2% average increases in exposure, respectively.

AB The residential sector, which represents one-third of global energy consumption and 40 % of CO2 emissions, has recently gained more attention with the long-term ambitious climate targets. The right pathway can be tracked by unveiling energy efficiency potential in residential buildings. This study aims to understand the reasons be-hind the increase in Turkish residential energy consumption and conduct a quantitative analysis to calculate the contribution of energy efficiency improvements to reduce energy consumption in Turkey between 2000 and 2018 using the decomposition analysis methodology Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index-I. Results show that the increase in population and wealth leads to a rise in residential energy consumption by 4.95 mtoe and 9.01 mtoe, respectively. The milder climatic conditions have resulted in a 2.25 mtoe reduction in space heating energy consumption. Energy efficiency resulted in a saving of 9.16 mtoe energy during the analysis period. Improve-ments in space heating made the most significant contribution to energy savings. Because of the increased own-ership rates of dishwashers and washing machines, the only end-use-where energy intensity did not improve-is seen as domestic hot water. The analysis also revealed that the Energy Efficiency Law and its secondary legislation have significantly accelerated energy efficiency improvements. The methods employed in this study can simply be adapted to any country to enlighten the policymakers in choosing the best policy options.(c) 2022 International Energy Initiative.

AB This study aims to forecast greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Hong Kong with an optimal selection of pre-dictors. A review is made on the time-series of the GHG emissions by different sources in 1992-2021. Twenty potential predictors are examined relating to economics, social developments, energy use, waste production and climatic conditions, based on previous studies on GHG emissions and mitigation. Three principal components produce well-fitting linear-log regression models. The model stability over time is verified by expanding window analysis. The model accuracy is assured by a CV(RMSE) of 6.1508% in the testing sets. Based on hierarchical clustering and stepwise regression, the gross floor area of construction projects is the most significant predictor to forecast GHG emissions, followed by the unemployment rate and the total expense in construction works. High levels of the three predictors facilitate GHG mitigation, but cannot meet the carbon neutral target. Carbon reduction technologies should be strengthened in growing construction projects. Electricity related carbon mitigation should be further enhanced. The novelty of this study is to provide insights to updating and priori-tizing decarbonization strategies in the next phase of Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan.

AB Urban areas' energy consumption accounts for almost three fourths the global energy use with 70% of the related emissions. Therefore, cities play a meaningful role in decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. This study presents a system dynamic approach to model the energy efficiency impact on the Togolese capital city's residential electricity consumption and carbon dioxide emissions reduction. The time spans from 2000 to 2050. An assessment of household appliances, such as lighting, refrigeration, cooling, and ventilation, was conducted along with monitoring electricity consumption of used and newly bought televisions, refrigerators, and freezers. Then, using Stella software, Lome's residential electricity consumption model was built based on the following variables: (1) population, (2) the number of existing households with access to electricity, (3) new homes having access to electricity, and (4) per capita electricity consumption. The model was calibrated and validated using data for the years 2000 to 2016. Afterward, this previous knowledge was used to evaluate three efficient energy policies: 1) business-as-usual scenario, 2) new policies scenario, and 3) sensitivity scenario. Lome's households present a predominantly low efficient appliances percentage. Therefore, the study found that substituting inefficient electric appliances with new and efficient models can lead Togo to substantial energy savings and reduce CO2 emissions of about 680 GWh and 350 kt in the horizon of 2050, respectively. Additionally, the findings of this study could stimulate policymakers to audit other sectors to implement related energy efficiency policies and/or set up corresponding energy management strategies in neighboring emerging countries.

AB The synergistic development of economic construction and low-carbon transformation of energy systems must be promoted for building a green, low-carbon, and cyclic economic system and achieving the "double carbon" goal in China. Based on the panel data of 30 provincial-level administrative regions in China from 2015 to 2019, the global entropy method, coupling coordination degree model, and spatial statistical analysis methods are applied to analyse the factors affecting the coupling effect. The coordination degree increased in the study period, with Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang being the regions with the highest values. The spatial distribution of the coupling coordination degree is strongly positively correlated with the eastern provincial-level administrative regions located in the high-high concentration area of the Moran scatterplot and western provincial-level administrative regions concentrated in the low-low concentration area. The spatial association pattern is stable in the study period, with only two provinces exhibiting a transition: Shandong province made the transition to high-high agglomeration areas, and Liaoning province made the transition to low-low agglomeration areas. The level of regional economy, urbanization process, energy consumption structure, and level of investment in science and innovation enhance the coupling coordination degree, whereas the industrial structure deteriorates this degree.

AB The need to develop sustainable strategies and solutions to design and retrofit buildings to be comfortable living environments that reduce energy and resource consumption is crucial in achieving the sustainable development goals put forth by the United Nations. This is the motivation for professionals to develop alternative approaches for problem-solving. The traditional linear model of course delivery in professional colleges helps in understanding the theoretical concepts and meeting the proposed educational objectives but underperforms in developing competent individuals who can collaborate and develop innovative solutions. Interdisciplinary and Transdisciplinary education models are gaining importance worldwide in this regard. Transforming the mode of teaching from dominant teacher centric lecture rooms to action centric realm beyond classrooms in a real physical setting will promote greater understanding and curiosity among students. This paper presents the detailed step to step process in a transdisciplinary exercise undertaken by undergraduate students of Architecture and Mechanical Engineering who have completed their respective courses on Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning and the learning outcome and the change in perception the learner group undergoes. The students work together as a team to perform a post-occupancy evaluation of the existing building stock of the campus and develop design solutions, both passive and active, to improve the existing condition of the campus consuming less energy and resources. Such transdisciplinary exercises helps prepare the students to solve real-life problems and do self-assessment and peer assessment of the theory and concept already studied, thus improving the perception of the students and the quality of the teaching-learning process. The project attempts to empower the students to be a part of sustainable initiatives in their surroundings, and the expertise developed through the project can be used in designing or retrofitting buildings to improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon emission and reduce the payback period.

AB One of the secrets for China's economic growth miracle is continuous investment in infrastructure, and the role of power infrastructure is irreplaceable. However, previous studies mostly focused on generation-side indicators rather than grid-side indicators, ignoring the importance of the mega-grid established in China. As a result, this paper is committed to exploring the economic growth pulling effect of power grids with different voltage levels in the nonlinear framework. On the premise of determining the robustness of estimation parameters by instrumental variable method, the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model is used to capture panel heterogeneity. To be exact, the regional economic growth driven by extra-high voltage (EHV) and ultra-high voltage (UHV) power grids presents a regime transition accompanied by the growth of regional power generation and electricity consumption per capita. This means that the mega-grid is more conducive to the economic growth of energy bases and load centers. To further build and improve the state-leveled mega-grid into a nationwide basic platform for trans-regional renewable energy transmission and distribution is a key measure to enhance China's sustainable economic growth under the constraints of carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets.

AB With an accelerated process of urbanization and improved standards of living, metropolises have a great responsibility and high potential to mitigate the global carbon emissions and Shiraz city is not an exception. There has been no comprehensive understanding of the carbon emissions in this area. So, the present study aimed to evaluate the environmental performance and trend prediction for five sub-sectors of urban management, namely transportation, municipal buildings, residential buildings, municipal waste disposal, and wastewater in Shiraz metropolis, Iran. In this study, the first section evaluated the environmental emissions, and in the second section, CO2-eq emissions were predicted based on two factors, population growth rate and GDP per capita, for Shiraz metropolis, Iran. For this purpose, the CURB tool was used to calculate the CO2-eq of each sector. Data were collected from the 2018 Shiraz Municipality statistical yearbook, published articles related to each sector, subsector annual statistical reports, and the World Bank, OECD, and IPCC. The results showed that the residential and urban transport sectors had the highest impact on total CO2-eq emissions. The residential sector accounted for the highest share (2,233,532 t CO2-eq) (60%), followed by the urban transport sector (1,169,927 t CO2-eq) (31%). The results of the second section indicated that 5,881,360 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent can be emitted in this city in the future (in 2035). The results indicated that Shiraz city does not have a significant share in greenhouse gas emissions compared with similar cities from two perspectives of development level and climate similarity index.

AB Purpose The residential buildings sector has a high priority in the climate change adaptation process due to significant CO2 emissions, high energy consumption and negative environmental impacts. The article investigates how, conversely speaking, the residential buildings will be affected by climate change, and how to improve existing structures and support long-term decisions. Design/methodology/approach The climate dataset was created using the scenarios determined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and this was used in the study. Different building envelope and Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems scenarios have been developed and simulated. Then, the best scenario was determined with comparative results, and recommendations were developed. Findings The findings reveal that future temperature-increase will significantly impact buildings' cooling and heating energy use. As the outdoor air temperatures increase due to climate change, the heating loads of the buildings decrease, and the cooling loads increase significantly. While the heating energy consumption of the house was calculated at 170.85 kWh/m(2) in 2020, this value shall decrease significantly to 115.01 kWh/m(2) in 2080. On the other hand, the cooling energy doubled between 2020 and 2080 and reached 106.95 kWh/m(2) from 53.14 kWh/m(2) measured in 2020. Originality/value Single-family houses constitute a significant proportion of the building stock. An in-depth analysis of such a building type is necessary to cope with the devastating consequences of climate change. The study developed and scrutinised energy performance improvement scenarios to define the climate change adaptation process' impact and proper procedure. The study is trying to create a strategy to increase the climate resistance capabilities of buildings and fill the gaps in this regard.

AB Building fabric retrofitting is an important first step in improving building energy efficiency. The United Kingdom's (UK) housing stock is one of the most inefficient in Europe, and Northern Ireland has the second-highest level of fuel poverty in the UK. This Northern Irish case study developed three fabric retrofit scenarios that estimate potential demand reductions, CO2 emissions removals and retrofit costs. The first scenario reduces domestic demand by 10% and removes 6% of domestic emissions. The second scenario is more ambitious than the first, and results in an 18% reduction in demand and 12% of emissions removed. The third scenario proposes fabric retrofitting to PassivHaus standard and results in a 42% reduction in demand and 27% of emissions removed. Furthermore, retrofit schemes can provide up to approximately 350,000 jobs annually between 2022 and 2050 for the Northern Irish population. This study demonstrates how fabric retrofit scenarios can be streamlined to the unique features of a housing stock. It shows that fabric retrofit research is important for the formulation of energy efficiency policy and emphasises that domestic sector retrofitting will yield socioeconomic and environmental benefits locally and internationally.

AB The continuously growing transportation sector has become the second largest, yet increasing, industrial emissions source of CO2, posing serious challenges to global environmental security. Among the various transport modes, road transportation yields the highest cumulative level of CO2 emissions. However, these emissions have not been sufficiently investigated in previous studies, especially with respect to analyses from the perspective of vehicle emission sources. This can make source management and emissions reduction difficult. To address these methodological issues, this study aims to build a highway traffic carbon emissions monitoring and spatial analysis system, employing the mobile carbon sources concept, and establish a carbon emissions model encompassing all types of passenger and freight vehicles based on interstation O-D traffic flow data recorded by the toll collection network, to calculate vehicle carbon emissions and create a mobile carbon source emissions map. Empirical analyses in Guangdong Province revealed that, compared with conventional studies, the mobile carbon source emission mapping approach can accurately identify vehicle types with higher emissions while assisting with source management. Of the average total daily carbon emissions from all types of vehicles that use highways (15,311 t), 57.10% originated from freight vehicles (8,743 t) while passenger vehicles contributed 42.90%. By specific vehicle type, emissions mainly originated from small and medium-sized vehicles, including Class I passenger vehicles (i.e., cars) and Class I and III freight vehicles. Further, the proposed method could locate road sections characterized by high carbon emissions. High-emission sections in Guangdong Province were mainly spatially autocorrelated, with peak aggregations on national highways; near economically developed and densely populated areas; and adjacent to surrounding airports, ports, and overpass roads. This study improves the scientific and spatial analytical accuracy for carbon emissions measurements of highway vehicles, thus informing source management and sustainable development, as well as providing technical support for attaining carbon neutrality in China.

AB With China's ongoing urbanisation, large cities in the south eastern coastal areas entered a phase of rapid development and face many challenges, such as the need for housing alongside the depletion of resources. Continuously updated energy saving standards have been improving thermal condition of building envelopes throughout the last decades. However, less is known regarding the building life-cycle recourse use and carbon emission. Existing estimation methods are difficult to be used as a tool in design practice due to their complexity. In this study, focusing on the city of Qingdao as a case study, life-cycle resource use and carbon emission were investigated on the basis of typified buildings. A matrix of building carbon intensity was established, which can be used as a benchmark in design practice. It simplifies the process of estimation especially on large scale such as neighbourhood or city, and still remain the sensibility to design changes. As an application example, three neighbourhoods in Qingdao, differing in building and population densities, were comparatively analysed to determine the impact of urban density on carbon emission and to assess the possibility of achieving carbon neutrality; also by investigating the possibility of achieving this target through recycling and renewable energy. The findings could support the practice of sustainable urban planning in the future.

AB This study proposes a hybrid Solar PV/Wind backup solution for a marine tugboat. Tugs are an important kind of vessel that should be able to maneuver continuously without any interruption of their electrical energy system. New power management integrating a hybrid solar/wind energy aims to ensure a long period of continuous safe operation in case of a total blackout and also to replace the perturbed power grid of the port for a partial time. These standard tugs built in Holland by DAMEN shipyard and attached to Arzew port in Algeria, are suited to operate for a maximum of 1 hour with a storage battery unit in an emergency situation like a blackout. The two main diesel engines are able to operate normally with 24 V DC voltage control under such situations. During this problem of power failure, the tug can't reach safely the harbor and hence immediate assistance is needed. To avoid this scenario, the idea is why not extend this period of emergency operation, and also try to supply the vessel inside the port only with clean energy. First, the electrical distribution system is presented and detailed including the power demand study of installed loads. The proposed hybrid energy source is also discussed for its many benefits especially in the case of favorable maritime climatic conditions of the Arzew port area. HOMER software is used to verify if the new power scheme can succeed. The results confirm that the new combined Diesel/PV/Wind solution appears to be very interesting, it reduces CO2 emissions from diesel generators and annual fuel costs can be saved.

AB Human intervention in forested ecosystems is hoped to perform a fundamental shift within the next decade by reverting current forest loss-a major source of CO2 emissions-to net forest gain taking up carbon and thus aiding climate change mitigation. The demanded extensive establishment of forests will change the local surface energy fluxes, and with it the local climate, in addition to competing with food and fiber production for land and water. Scenario building models encompass this competition for resources but have turned a blind eye to the biogeophysical (BGP) local surface energy flux disturbance so far. We combine the benefit of CO2 sequestration of afforestation/reforestation (A/R) with the additional incentive or penalty of local BGP induced cooling or warming by translating the local BGP induced temperature change to a CO2 equivalent. We then include this new aspect in the land-use model Model for Agricultural Production and their Impact on the Environment (MAgPIE) via modifying the application of the price on greenhouse gases (GHGs). This enables us to use MAgPIE to produce A/R scenarios that are optimized for both their potential CO2 sequestration and the CO2 equivalent local BGP effect, as well as the socio-economic trade-offs of A/R. Here we show that optimal A/R patterns are substantially altered by taking the local BGP effects into account. Considering local cooling benefits of establishing forests triples (+203.4%) the viable global A/R area in 2100 from 116 to 351 Mha under the conditions of the shared socioeconomic pathway 2 (SSP2) scenario driven by the same GHG price. Three quarters (76.0%, +179 Mha) of the additionally forested area is established in tropical climates alone. Therefore, a further neglect of BGP effects in scenario building models undervalues the benefit of tropical forests while simultaneously running the risk of proposing counterproductive measures at high latitudes. However, the induced focus on tropical forestation intensifies the competition with food production where forests contribute most to mitigation. A/R related trade-offs need to be considered alongside their climate benefit to inhibit unintentional harm of mitigation efforts.

AB In developing countries, connections between rural households' energy access, efficiency of cooking technologies, and relevant factors are less understood. This study investigates household-level cooking stove's carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions, perceptions, and influencing factors in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Methods involve a survey of 176 randomly selected households with a pre-tested questionnaire, and relevant measurements of traditional cooking stoves (TCS) and improved cooking stoves (ICS) of the households in three different categories: nearby, far, and very far from a protected forest area. Results show that most of the households use double-mouthed TCS, although ICS can save 27% fuels and 25% CO2 emissions compared to TCS. Between 44% to 84% of the respondents prefer ICS because these are less labor intensive, emission-friendly as well as fuel- and time- efficient. The perception varies significantly between the households located far away and nearby the park. The amount of fuelwood and total biomass fuels used in the TCS tends to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those in the ICS, which corresponds to the higher emissions in TCS. We also find that a household releases six times higher CO2 emissions from burning fuelwood and other biomass fuels compared to use of non-renewable fuels. Households with pucca (brick-built) houses, financial affluency, education, large family size, away from the park, and larger homestead area tend to release more emissions from the use of fuelwood and non-renewable fuels. This study finding can help policymakers make informed decisions in implementing ICS and other cleaner biomass-based projects.

AB Coral reefs are facing increasingly devasting impacts from ocean warming and acidification due to anthropogenic climate change. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, potential solutions have focused either on reducing light stress during heating, or on the potential for identifying or engineering "super corals". A large subset of these studies, however, have tended to focus primarily on the bleaching response of corals, and assume erroneously that corals that bleach earlier in a thermal event die first. Here, we explore how survival, observable bleaching, coral skeletal growth (as branch extension and densification), and coral tissue growth (protein and lipid concentrations) varies for conspecifics collected from distinctive reef zones at Heron Island on the Southern Great Barrier Reef. A reciprocal transplantation experiment was undertaken using the dominant reef building coral (Acropora formosa) between the highly variable reef flat and the less variable reef slope environments. Coral colonies originating from the reef flat had higher rates of survival and amassed greater protein densities but calcified at reduced rates compared to conspecifics originating from the reef slope. The energetics of both populations however potentially benefited from greater light intensity present in the shallows. Reef flat origin corals moved to the lower light intensity of the reef slope reduced protein density and calcification rates. For A. formosa, genetic differences, or long-term entrainment to a highly variable environment, appeared to promote coral survival at the expense of calcification. The response decouples coral survival from carbonate coral reef resilience, a response that was further exacerbated by reductions in irradiance. As we begin to discuss interventions necessitated by the CO2 that has already been released into the atmosphere, we need to prioritise our focus on the properties that maintain valuable carbonate ecosystems. Rapid and dense calcification by corals such as branching Acropora is essential to the ability of carbonate coral reefs to rebound following disturbance events and maintain 3D structure but may be the first property that is sacrificed to enable coral genet survival under stress.

AB Growing global environmental problems force us to think about their impact and search for ways to protect the environment. While the construction industry and the production of construction materials contribute to environmental pollution, they also offer great potential for addressing many environmental problems. Important opportunities exist in the use and processing of a whole host of industrial and construction waste and in the use of mineral resources. Among such mineral resources is magnesite, whose deposits in Slovakia are abundant. The current sustainability trends impose strict requirements on construction materials and products, favoring solutions with sufficient ecological and efficiency performance characteristics. With this focus on efficient and sustainable solutions in mind, the objective of this research was to analyze magnesium oxide construction boards, as they are the most commonly used construction product based on MgO. The specific MgO-based boards that were studied were applied in selected constructions built using the so-called dry method of construction and were compared with traditional material solutions. The research methodology is based on an analysis of computational models of the proposed variants to determine selected thermal-technical parameters. The analyses of external and interior structures presented in this work suggest that when boards based on MgO and traditional materials are used for coating constructions built using the dry method of construction, the former provide certain benefits in terms of energy accumulation, improving living comfort, and in terms of the fire resistance of constructions, improving overall safety. The conclusion of the presented article is devoted to discussions with works that addressed various perspectives on the application of MgO in the field of materials research. The findings from this analysis are beneficial especially in terms of expanding the knowledge in the area.

AB Air pollution, which causes over seven million deaths per year, is the most significant and specifically related to health impacts. Nearly 90% of the urban population worldwide is exposed to pollution not meeting the World Health Organization guidelines for air quality. Many atmospheric carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emitting sources, such as inefficient energy and polluting transportation, directly impact health. Natural gas maritime transport from various parts of the world (carbon supplied to consuming areas) has become more critical. Natural gas liquefaction offers a cleaner and more efficient transportation option and also increases its storage capacity. It is expected that natural gas will reduce the human health impact compared with other traditional fuels consumed. This research establishes a life cycle assessment model of air emission and social human health impact related to LNG maritime transport to investigate the impact of each type of fuel used for the numerous maritime carriers. In order to build a model for air emissions and social human health impact assessments based on hypotheses on various unknown criteria, a calculation model is used. The results revealed Conventional-2 fuel type has the lowest human health impact for annual mode calculations, followed by Conventional-1, Q-Max, and finally Q-Flex. The analysis method for the per year demonstrated discrepancies in the relative human health impact due to the variation of the annual LNG demand by each destination and not only per the trip needs. The results show the importance of using a relatively cleaner fuel type such as Conventional-2 in reducing the health impact of LNG maritime transportation. Moreover, it shows differences in the air emissions as well as the human health impact based on the destination's location and annual LNG demand

AB Sustainable comfortable living requires comprehensive energy consumption planning for the housing habitat. Besides other energy planning considerations, the variations in physical features of built facilities, their environmental interaction, and resulting operational life cycle carbon footprint are an important focus in contemporary research. Therefore, this research aims to explore the relationship between the physical features of the built facility and the resulting carbon footprint for conventional housing designs. A combination of conventional Malaysian model housing units was developed in 3D virtual prototypes by building information modeling, and regression analysis was used to investigate the environmental impact paradigm of the built facility. Correspondingly, an operational CO2 pre-assessment was also examined by the partial life cycle assessment technique during the early stages of design and planning. The results of this study show a positive and statistically significant linear relation of carbon footprint with the area, volume, and power rating parameters. The outcome of this study is imperative for designing resource-efficient living facilities and achieving a sustainable built environment through a proactive life cycle assessment of housing construction projects.

AB Lighting energy consumption occupies a large proportion in the building electricity consumption. It cannot only save energy, but also reduce the uneven and constant illumination of the working face, which makes full use of the natural lighting and combines with the intelligent lighting control. An office building in Zhengzhou of China has been selected as an example for analyzing the climatic factors that influence building daylighting and the factors of the building itself, the illuminance of working faces in different sky models and at different times has been simulated and calculated to analyze the illuminance variation law in the direction of room depth and parallel direction of side Windows. Partition and point combined constant illumination control strategy for the lamps in different areas has been put forward and realized by BP neural network algorithm. By controlling the dimming of artificial light source and adjusting the curtain opening degree intelligently, uniform and constant illumination has been achieved. Energy saving effect in combination with natural lighting has been evaluated to prove that the control strategy cannot only maintain constant illumination in every working face but also significantly reduce the electric energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

AB In South Korea, efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and environmental impacts from the perspective of life cycle assessment (LCA) are important because of the implementation of zero-energy building certification for public buildings and the promotion of net-zero policy. Therefore, it is critical to develop cement alternatives with low embodied energy and less environmental impact. In this study, the applicability of "highly sulfated calcium silicate cement (HSCSC)," an eco-friendly binder developed by our research team, was investigated. Its basic properties and environmental footprint reduction effects were examined in comparison with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and Portland blast furnace slag cement (PBSC). The environmental impacts of the HSCSC were analyzed using the LCA method. The results confirmed that HSCSC can be considered an excellent alternative to conventional OPC or PBSC in certain areas as an eco-friendly binder that can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and environmental impacts. Moreover, compared to OPC and PBSC, the probability of HSCSC affecting the human body is extremely low. The results of this study may contribute to the development and practical use of cements that minimize climate impacts, as well as improve the efficacy of future research on embodied energy saving.

AB Buildings contribute about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in the USA. The estimation of urban building fossil fuel CO2 emissions with the fine spatial and temporal resolution is critical for climate change studies and developing optimal plans for reaching emission reduction goals. This study proposed a new method to map fossil fuel CO2 emissions at the building level and hourly scale. Specifically, a building energy use model was developed and used for modeling building energy consumption at the hourly scale through integrating building prototypes from the accessor's data, the number of floors from remote sensing data, floor area from footprint data, and energy use intensity from the Energy Plus model. Furthermore, the greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator was applied to convert calculated building energy consumption to greenhouse gas emissions at the building level and hourly scale. Research results indicate that the spatial distribution pattern of fossil fuel CO2 emissions is largely decided by building type, building height, and building density. In particular, the largest fossil fuel CO2 emissions are located in the center of Manhattan which is composed of large offices and hotels. In terms of temporal pattern, stable and similar monthly greenhouse gas emissions could be detected throughout four seasons, and two small emission peaks could be found in around July and December which are caused by high cooling electricity use and high gas heating consumption. The hourly emissions patterns also indicate the active relationship between fossil fuel CO2 emissions and daily human activities.

AB Worldwide energy supply is mostly reliant on fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide emissions have caused many negative environmental issues like climate change, air pollution, and energy security. An important alternative to this hazard is substituting the fossil fuel-based carbon energy sources with renewable energy sources. Passive strategies, which are devised to provide thermal comfort in buildings are examples of how to use renewable energies. For this study, a dairy product warehouse in the city of Yazd in Iran was thoroughly investigated. The main goal of this study is to introduce different scenarios, then identifying them based upon optimization of energy consumption. Another main purpose of the present study is to maximize the use of passive energy to meet the cooling needs of a dairy products warehouse in the studied area. Underground temperature is lower than the surface in summer, also it is higher in winter. Therefore, this property of soil is investigated by using nine different scenarios at different heights for constructing underground warehouse for storing dairy products. Clearly, different renewable tools like wind turbine, wind catcher, solar chiller, and different roof designs by Savanah grass, roof pond are also investigated. At first, the cooling load of the warehouse is calculated separately for each season. Then, according to the energy load values obtained, the nominated scenarios are investigated. The results of the comparisons show that the construction of a warehouse at a depth of 3 m from the ground with a green roof covered with Savannah grass helps achieve the best degree of reduction in the cooling power.

AB Owing to stricter building energy requirements, future buildings will be characterized by low base loads and occasional high peaks. However, future building areas will still contain existing and historical buildings with high energy demand. Meanwhile, there is a requirement that future building areas should obtain energy from renewable energy sources, while existing buildings need to be transited to renewables. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an approach for modelling energy pathways for future Norwegian residential building areas by analyzing different energy supply systems. Several calculation methods were combined: building simulation, energy supply technology simulation, heat demand aggregation, and data post-processing. The results showed that the energy pathways would be very dependent on CO2-factors for energy sources, and it is hard to predict accurate CO2-factors. An increasing housing stock development would slightly increase the CO2 emissions towards 2050, although the new buildings used much less energy and the existing buildings underwent renovation. A constant housing stock would yield a 22-27% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2050. This showed that implementing stricter building codes had a lower impact on the total CO2 emissions than CO2-factors and energy technologies. The focus should lie on energy supply systems.

AB The diversified and efficient use of sustainable energy resources is becoming more crucial day-by-day in today's energy-dependent world. In response to such a situation, alternative energy sources should be evaluated, especially on a regional basis. The recent pandemic and its effects show that the effective and widespread use of green energy sources should be increased, because air pollution causes an increased rate of COVID19 virus transmission. It is necessary to re-plan all sustainable energy resources on a regional basis because of the negative environmental impacts of burning fossil energy. On a global scale, there is an initiative to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions related to renewable energy sources by 70% by 2050. In many applications, efficiency analysis and new technologies are among the primary topics. As the rate of urbanization rises, there is a great need for integrated new energy technologies that control local energy efficiency standards for cities, or even buildings. Urban planning is crucial to reducing energy use in buildings. Turkey aims to install 34 gigawatts (GW) of hydroelectric capacity, 20GW of wind energy, 5GW of solar energy, and 1GW power from geothermal or biomass-based on strategic green energy plans. Turkey will provide about 30 % of its total energy needs via renewable energy sources based on this plan by 2023. As is known, one of the most important sustainable energy sources is solar power derived from solar radiation. Solar power has a characteristic pattern compared to other sustainable energy sources, not only in seasonal but also in daily terms. The geographical requirements, vast flat terrain, and high irradiation levels of solar power plants make it ideal for promoting economic growth in the Central Anatolian inner regions of technological investments. In this study, we present estimations based on model results for the monthly variation of solar energy potential, efficiency. Study areas are in the vicinity of Ankara (Camlidere and Kecioren) in Central Anatolia. To forecast solar energy potential, hourly solar radiation (watt/m2) was processed with five years of data (from 2014 to 2018). Deep learning methodologies were applied to solar radiation data to build up future solar radiation data scenarios in 5-year forecast through the end of 2024. A 3-layer artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of 128-neurons with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation was applied to the solar data. An LSTM layer using 64 neurons with ReLU activation functions for each neuron, was applied to build the hidden layer up. The output layer was built on the hidden dense layer using 2-neurons with a linear activation function. Solar power efficiency and performance of ANN models in the annual basin are presented in two study areas. The model's performance increases by up to 98% to estimate solar radiation and sunshine duration. There is sufficient evidence based on the results to invest in renewable energy sources using solar energy converting systems at both study areas.

AB Hot water supply is one of the leading consumers of energy in the building sector in cold climate areas. The use of woody biomass is effective in reducing CO2 emissions in hot-water supply systems. This report deals with a system that combines a wood pellet boiler (PB) and a heat pump system with CO2 (CO2HP) that is used in a facility for disabled people. The following research was conducted. The operation of a hybrid system combining a PB and CO(2)HPs was investigated. While operating the system, four specific operations were developed as countermeasures to save on costs and reduce system troubles while reducing CO2 emissions. The processes and results are introduced. Numerical simulations were carried out to optimize the operation. The hot water temperature, water volume, and hot water loads were simulated. The influence of the water volume ratio on the cost and primary energy consumption under the requirements for safe system operation was studied. The regional economic ripple effects (REREs) of this system were studied. The wood pellet boiler is not only a measure for reducing primary energy consumption but can also play an important role in a regional economy for sustainable development in countries that import energy resources such as Japan.

AB School buildings represent an energy-consuming sector of real estate where different efficiency actions are necessary. The literature shows how the design of a multi-energy system offers numerous advantages, however, there are problems related to the integration of cogeneration units with renewable energy sources due to the low flexibility of the first one and the high degree of uncertainty of the latter. The authors provide an alternative solution through the analysis of a case study consisting of a multiple energy system in three Sicilian schools, focusing on the system's operational strategy, on the design and sizing of components and trying to exploit the energy needs complementarity of buildings instead of integrating the conventional energy storage systems. Not considering school activities in summer, it was decided to install a cogeneration unit sized on winter thermal loads, whereas the electricity demand not covered was reduced with photovoltaic systems designed to maximize production for seasonal use and with loads concentrated in the morning hours. The effectiveness of this idea, which can be replicated for similar users and areas, is proved by a payback time of less than 11 years and a reduction of 31.77% of the CO2 emissions.

AB Buildings are the most important part of development activities, consumed over one-thirds of the global energy. Household used the maximum energy around the world, likewise in Pakistan residential buildings consumed about half of total energy (45.9% per year). The study aims to analyze the impact of building design on climate of Metropolitan City Karachi, Pakistan and to evaluate the change in urbanization patterns and energy consumption in the buildings. To have better understanding of the issues correlations was established amongst population, urbanization patterns, green area, number of buildings (residential and commercial), building design, energy consumption and metrological records (climate change parameters) by collecting the data from the respective departments. With the help of the collected data amount of carbon dioxide was estimated. The results reveled that during last 36 years the urban population of Karachi increased exponentially from 5,208,000 (1981) to 14,737,257 (2017) with increase in urbanized area from 8.35 km(2) (1946) to 3,640 km(2) (2017) that may led to reduce the green area of the city from 495,000 hectors (1971) to 100,000 hectors (2015). Moreover, the building's design and numbers are being changed from 21 high-rise buildings (2009) to 344 (2017). It may be concluded that change in temperature pattern and climatic variability of the city may be due to increase in population and change in lifestyle that lead to high energy consumption that is prime source of increased in CO2 emission in the environment of Karachi city, However, Greenhouse Gases (GHG) releases are much lower than the levels reported from metropolitan cities around the world.

AB Compact housing structures located in city centers are considered to be the most energy and environmentally effective, mainly due to the access to services, transport networks and municipal infrastructures. There is the question of why so many of the acknowledged ecological housing complexes are located on the outskirts of cities or suburbs. Numerous cities decide to introduce strategies either to densify city centers, hoping to improve energy efficiency. The Tricity metropolitan area is a special case undergoing dynamic transformation, and its development overlaps with the processes of both planned densification of the center as well as uncontrolled suburbanization. The goal of this study was to find the correlation between optimal location of an eco-district from the functional center of the Tricity metropolitan area, allowing for the most favorable energy and environmental parameters related both to the architectural and urban scale. The research was conducted in four different scenarios, concerning present and future development. In these scenarios, specific locations were examined, and the following were compared: total energy consumption, ecological footprint and CO2 lifecycle emissions. This study shows the possibility for suburban housing complexes with appropriate parameters in an edge city model to have the same or better results than complexes situated closer to the functional center of the city. This is mainly due to the building's energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, municipal infrastructure and relevant service access. The research proves the importance of implementing sustainable energy-saving and environmentally oriented activities at both an architectural and urban scale planning process.

AB Utilization of renewable energy, improvement of power generation efficiency, and reduction of fossil fuel consumption are important strategies for the Chinese power industry in response to climate change and environment challenges. Solar thermal energy can be integrated into a conventional coal-fired power unit to build a solar-aided coal-fired power generation (SACPG) system. Because solar heat can be used more efficiently in a SACPG system, the solar-coal hybrid power system can reduce coal consumption and CO(2)emissions. The performance and costs of a SACPG system are affected by the respective characteristics of its coal-fired system and solar thermal power system, their coupling effects, the solar energy resource, the costs of the solar power system, and other economic factors of coal price and carbon price. According to the characteristics of energy saving and CO(2)emission reductions of a SACPG system, a general methodology of CO(2)abatement cost for the hybrid system is proposed to assess the solar thermal energy integration reasonably and comprehensively. The critical factors for carbon abatement cost are also analyzed. Taking a SACPG system of 600 MW in Jinan, Shandong and in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia in China as an example, the methodology is further illustrated. The results show that the efficiency of solar heat-to-electricity should be high and it is 0.391 in the scheme of SIH1 in Hohhot, and that the designed direct normal irradiation (DNI) should be greater than 800 W/m(2)in order to make full use of solar energy resources. It is indicated that the abatement cost of a SACPG system depends significantly both on the cost of solar power system and its relevant costs, and also on the fuel price or the carbon prices, and that the carbon abatement cost can be greatly reduced as the coal prices or CO(2)price increase. The methodology of carbon abatement cost can provide support for the comprehensive assessment of a SACPG system for its design and optimal performance.

AB Traditionally, the uniform application of thermal insulation is practised within the built environment sector to achieve desired building regulation standards for energy efficiency. However, that approach does not follow the building heat loss field, and it is therefore poorly matched to the actual heat loss from the building, thus achieving sub-optimum energy performance. This research aims to visualise building heat loss field in three dimensions and to create self-organised thermal insulation patterns that are proportional in thickness to the intensity of heat loss. This is achieved using a 3D agent-based model, in which each agent that represents a miniature object of thermal insulation moves up the gradient of the heat loss representation and competes for its position with the neighbouring thermal insulation components, depending upon the gradient intensity. This creates a self-organised thermal insulation pattern through the competition between the thermal insulation components and through overcrowding in the areas with higher heat loss intensity. This helps to visualise the heat loss field and create a representation of thermal insulation that is ideally matched to it. The result is assessed for its energy performance using a conventional energy performance analysis. That analysis shows that this approach leads to reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions in comparison with the conventional approach that uses the same amount of thermal insulation material. The overall result increases our understanding of 3D heat loss and introduces a new approach for designing building thermal insulation.

AB As the Chinese economy has rapidly developed, energy consumption and carbon emissions in China's rural areas have also steadily increased. Rural communities are the most important component of rural areas; as such, developing low-carbon communities will likely promote reductions in rural carbon emissions. This study performed a comprehensive analysis of land use change from the aspects of land use type and land use intensity and examined the effect on carbon storage. The results show that built-up land occupation of cropland was the main land use type change pattern. The period of 2013-2018 presented the most obvious land use type change. This study can also provide a reference case and experience for the Chinese government.

AB Buildings represent a significant proportion of total carbon and energy emissions worldwide and play an important role in the formulation of sustainable development strategies. Several countries have adopted or consider the possibility of establishing Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) as their future energy targets to alleviate the problems related to the depletion of energy resources and the deterioration of the environment. The objective of this contribution is to expose the research trends in ZEB technologies.
   To achieve this goal, the contribution is supported by an article review carried out in the academic directory Scopus. The information extracted from this catalog was processed in the VOSviewer software, through which the text mining, map of terms and networks of investigative action was carried out. The consumption of energy and resources of buildings, from the design stage; it has become the most studied research topic since 2015. The research detects niches of research in three areas: life cycle cost analysis, environmental impact, and social policies.

AB Tourism is one of the main sources of income in some of the countries around the world. The hotel industry has thus become one of the main industries. Hotels are one of the most energy intensive building categories and the hospitality industry contributes to 2% of the world's CO2 emissions. At present, new buildings can be made energy efficient even from the design stage but existing buildings consume more energy than the new ones. Building energy efficiency retrofitting techniques should be applied, based on economics, to existing buildings to reduce the high energy consumption. This paper presents a review on energy performance and energy intensive areas of some existing hotel buildings at different tourist destinations in the world. Energy retrofitting technologies should be mainly focused on these energy intensive areas. It also provides a review of common retrofitting technologies and past studies on hotel building retrofits. Finally, it discusses the harriers for retrofit projects and a market mechanism to carry out successful retrofit projects. After seeing more than 50% of energy saving in retrofitted hotels, this paper concludes that all possible retrofitting technologies should be implemented from now on and measure the energy performance both before and after retrofitting.

AB Nowadays, climate change characterized by global warming exerts a huge impact on natural ecosystems and human society, threatening the sustainable development increasingly. Global warming is mainly caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the realization of a low-carbon or even zero-carbon energy supply worldwide is the fundamental way to combat climate change.
   Under such circumstances, this paper introduces the concept, vision, construction planning, and key technologies of Global Energy Interconnection. Actually, Global Energy Interconnection is a large-scale energy platform for the highly efficient deployment of clean energy around the world. Establishing Global Energy Interconnection has many advantages. On one hand, it can build a new pattern of energy development with breaking through the resources in time and space, and environment constraints, and achieve sufficient clean energy supply efficiently. On the other hand, it can stimulate economic growth while strengthening the momentum of development, releasing the innovation dividends, promoting cooperation, and accelerating the coordinating development of the world economy. In addition, it can create a beautiful new life for the global society while improving the natural environment, achieving the ecological sustainable development, promoting the harmonious development of mankind, and accelerating the upgrading of civilization. The main solutions and key technology foundations of establishing Global Energy Interconnection include the large-scale clean energy development technology, UHV transmission technology, and smart grid technology. Global Energy Interconnection is composed of intercontinental backbone grids, intracontinental backbone grids and different voltage-level grids within countries. The construction of Global Energy Interconnection is divided into three phases: 2035, 2050, and 2070. Eventually, the "9 Horizontal and 9 Vertical" global energy interconnection backbone grid will be formed, which will widely connect large-scale clean energy bases and load centers, promoting large-scale, wide-area and highly-efficient optimal global allocation of clean energy.
   In general, the construction of Global Energy Interconnection has extremely high comprehensive benefits. Despite of technical feasibility, further improvements are still needed, including large-scale clean energy transmission and consumption, UHV flexible DC transmission technology, superconducting transmission technology, large power grid operation control technology and corresponding key equipments, etc. Moreover, the construction of Global Energy Interconnection also requires countries around the world to reach a consensus on political concepts and relevant policies, build a benign market environment, promote comprehensive technological progress in various industries, and provide solutions for large-scale development, global allocation, and efficient use of clean energy as well as the sustainable development of energy, economy, society and environment.

AB Most of the municipalities in Europe have a population of less than 6000 inhabitants and high energy consumption. In order to reduce consumption, it is necessary to know the energy behaviour of a municipality beforehand. The purpose of this article is to analyse the energy and environmental situation of the municipalities of the province of Badajoz (Spain) and formulates energy efficiency and environmental indicators. The method is based in the analysis of 74 energy audits were carried out between 2012 and 2014 in the corresponding municipalities, and the average final energy consumption was studied in terms of four different variables: area of the municipality, number of inhabitants, cost of energy, and annual CO2 emissions. In addition, a statistical analysis based on variance was carried out. The results obtained show that the average annual energy consumption of a municipality of less than 6000 inhabitants is 300 kWh per inhabitant and 1 kWh per m(2) of surface area. A great variability was observed in the average cost of energy for each municipality, between 0.11 and 0.25 Euro/kWh, with an average of 0.17 Euro/kWh. In addition, by statistical methods it was determined that the energy consumption of a municipality is proportional to the surface area that it occupies and its number of inhabitants, proposing an equation that allows determining the final energy consumption according to both variables. This benchmarking is valid to implement energy saving techniques and to prioritize investments in the renovation of the facilities. There are no precedents of similar research studies with such a large number of municipalities.

AB Minimum airflow rates are either recommended or required based on the number of occupants, the intended use of the space or the floor plan area. This paper focuses on a new proposal for Spanish Technical Building Code based on limitations of the ventilation using the CO2 concentration as an indicator. The aim of the proposal is to introduce indoor air quality criteria in order to determine the design ventilation rates, and as a result, reduce the ventilation energy losses.
   Based on this proposal, the perceived indoor air quality in terms of the concentration of CO2 and other contaminants of concern is analysed through simulation. Maximum allowed area-based emission rates are defined for the indoor source contaminants. It was found that the minimum outdoor airflow rates based on maximum allowable CO2 concentrations would reduce heating demand by more than 25% when compared to the reference airflow rates. In addition, the influence of the airtightness of the envelope on the indoor air quality is analysed with regards to defining the corresponding maximum allowed area-based emission rates. As the envelope permeability increases, the maximum allowed area-based emission rates decrease for HCHO and total volatile organic compound, and should be around 27% lower comparing to the design case values.

AB Dieser Artikel befasst sich mit der Erstellung eines Planungshilfsmittels fur Mischquartiere im Kontext des Projekts EnEff:Stadt - Bottrop, Welheimer Mark. Bei der Welheimer Mark handelt es sich um ein Mischgebiet innerhalb der InnovationCity Ruhr in Bottrop. Ziel war die energetische Optimierung des Quartiers zur Reduktion von Treibhausgasemissionen. Hierfur wurden Methoden zur Modellierung von komplexen Quartieren entwickelt und auf die Welheimer Mark angewandt. Simulierte thermische und elektrische Bedarfswerte einer Wohnsiedlung wichen um 6,4 % von den Verbrauchswerten ab. Wahrend fur die elektrische Profilgenerierung von Nichtwohngebauden kein hinreichendes, vereinfachtes Verfahren identifiziert wurde, wies die Methodik zur Erzeugung thermischer Lastprofile eine gute ubereinstimmung zwischen generierten und gemessenen Profilen auf. Aus einer Optimierung gingen Vorschlage fur eine verbesserte Energieanlagenverteilung hervor. Bei moderaten Kostensteigerungen von 6 % bis 11 % ware eine Reduktion von CO2-Emissionen um bis zu 50 % in bestimmten Bereichen der Welheimer Mark moglich.
   Abstract Modeling and optimization of mixed use areas. This article deals with the development of a planning tool for mixed use areas within the project En-Eff:Stadt - Bottrop, Welheimer Mark. The city district Welheimer Mark is a mixed use area within the InnovationCity Ruhr of Bottrop, Germany. The main aim was the energetic optimization of the city district to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, methods for complex city district modeling has been developed and used within Welheimer Mark district. Simulated thermal and electrical demands only showed a difference of 6.4 % related to energy consumption values. While a sufficient method for generation of electrical load profiles of non-residential buildings could not be identified, a method for generation of thermal load profiles shows a good fit between generated and measured loads. An optimization model has been used to identify an optimized energy system distribution. A greenhouse gas emission reduction up to 50 % is possible at cost increase of 6 % to 11 %.

AB Energy crisis and environmental pollution have become major challenges in China's economic development, which has triggered the demand for alternative energy sources and promoted the popularization of ground source heat pump technology. A ground source heat pump (GSHP) is a central heating and/or cooling system that transfers heat to or from the ground. It uses the earth as a heat source (in the winter) or a heat sink (in the summer). This design takes advantage of the moderate temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems. This paper adopted the STIRPAT model and the influencing factors were analyzed. The major influencing factors were population (P), urbanization level (U), GDP per capita (A), energy consumption per capita (E), industrial structure (IS), R&D (T), central heating area (HA), and policy investment (PI). However, these factors themselves had strong collinearity, which might produce some uncertain impacts on the final results. To avoid the impact of collinearity, the method of partial least squares (PLS) was used. The results showed that P, U, A, E, T, HA, and PI had positive effects on GSHP, while IS had a slight effect on GSHP. This paper found that A is the most dominant factor and the effect of the IS could almost be ignored. Some policy recommendations were given on how to promote the application of GSHP systems and mitigate the growth of CO2 emissions.

AB This study examines different restructuring measures for reference residential buildings in Germany. The subjects of the investigation are the calculated net, final and primary energy demand as well as the caused CO2 equivalent emissions and the resulting annuity. The purpose is to identify what kinds of measures have the biggest saving effects concerning the above-named parameters. There-for the German residential building stock is represented by nine reference buildings, ranging from single-to large multi-family homes. By the definition of four different building refurbishment levels, the characteristics of non-renovated buildings up to fully renovated buildings are taken into account. Remediation measures such as the building refurbishment or the decarbonisation of the heat generation are evaluated individually or combined. For the assessment of the whole residential building sector a building-quantity structure is developed. Lastly five different scenarios portraying the residential building sector in 2050 are evaluated with respect to the resulting final and primary energy demand as well as the caused CO2 equivalent emissions.

AB The performance of our cities in terms of how they deal with energy across a wide range of indicators is the key factor in reducing carbon emissions. The focus of this paper is a precinct in Perth which is about to be redeveloped. The proposed plan is modelled looking specifically at Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from: materials used in the construction, not only of the buildings but also the infrastructure (i.e. roads and paving in the public realm); electricity and gas consumption through the use of everyday residential and commercial appliances and equipment; the energy required for the pumping and treatment of water supplied to the development site including water required for the irrigation of public areas as well as for individual consumption; and private motor vehicles owned by residents on the development site. A baseline model representing the proposed plan built to existing codes and standards is used to determine the impact of a range of low-carbon interventions proposed for the development, including reducing parking and adding good quality public transport. Significant GHG emissions reductions of greater than 50% are possible at quite minimal additional cost due to the alternative systems of development that are found to be effective at a precinct scale. In order to achieve such precinct-scale innovations there are policy and regulatory barriers for electricity, thermal energy and water utility providers to overcome. There needs to be a reasonable business case for developers, energy service companies (ESCO's) and potential customers to enable investment in low carbon, precinct scale options. Some examples of these are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the possibilities to decrease energy consumption of a residential building in Serbian conditions are analyzed. The building uses electricity for space heating system, heating of domestic hot water, lighting, and for other electric equipment. The electrical energy is generated by photovoltaics (PV) system and it may be consumed by the building or may be fed-in to the electricity grid. The major aim of the optimization of PV area is to determine the avoided electricity from the grid (avoided exergy), and to minimize the consumption of primary energy. The residential buildings with variable thermal insulation thickness, hot water consumption, life time, and PV's embodied energy are investigated, in order to achieve zero-net energy building or positive-net energy building. The buildings are presented by a mathematical model, in EnergyPlus environment. Open Studio plug-in in Google SketchUp was used for building virtual design, Hooke-Jeeves algorithm for optimization, and GENOPT software for software execution control. For the different areas of photovoltaics, the investigations gave the results for their optimal values. In that way, the fossil energy consumption and CO2 emission are also minimized.

Calculations are done by creating model building that represents all existing building of which has 7.8, m height, 156 m(2) floor area, 3 stored and wooden framed single-glazed window system. Heating and cooling periods are taken up separately in different degree-day sections and optimum insulation thicknesses are obtained between 6 cm and 16 cm. Heating-cooling period of model building is 7 months-5 months for 1st DD section, 8 months-3 months for 2nd DD section, 10 months-2 months for 3th DD section and heating period is 10 months, no cooling period for 4th DD section. It is adopted that heating load is satisfied by natural gas, fuel-oil and coal and cooling load by electricity. Emission saving values which are dependent to fuel type and heating cooling period are determined between 28 % and 80 % for CO2, 58 % and 80 % for SO2 emissions. Results show that, dealing heating and cooling periods together in the analysis, produce effective solutions in order to ensure comfort conditions.

AB The largest influences on a building's cooling and heating load come from heat absorption and loss through building surfaces. Most of the heat gain is absorbed by a structure's roof. Applying insulation to building envelopes is an efficient approach to cut back on heating and cooling energy use as well as the damaging effects of the construction industry on the environment. As a result, it is extremely important to choose the right insulation material and determine the ideal insulation thickness. Eight diverse cities with a range of climatic variables that are spread over several Indian areas (geometric coordinates) are the starting point for this investigation. To overcome the constraints of the various climate typology representing the diverse climatic circumstances present in India, a generic method is proposed, considering the numerous climatic parameters for eight selected Indian locations. The subject of the project is the analysis of a composite insulation layer made from a combination of chosen seven insulating materials, each of which has a unique property. This building roof envelope is examined using ANSYS software and e-Quest building energy modeling. The results of simulations over the course of the whole year show a significant decrease in energy use and CO2 emissions. By altering the thickness of the created envelope, the annual energy need is decreased for each of the seven trials in the range of 30-90%. A decrease in heat flow results in sustainable buildings and a low-carbon future by lowering temperatures by 19 degrees and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 90% to 96%.

AB Building models are used to predict energy consumption and CO2 emissions under current and future conditions and serve as a basis for building design. The most important energy saving potentials in buildings can be achieved by improving the thermal performance of building and the efficiency of the district heating system. This study investigated energy savings in buildings in cold and hot regions of China and Africa and developed a modeling approach for energy savings in heating and cooling of residential buildings. We have provided an overview of long-term scenarios for energy demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Using the industry-renowned software RETScreen, parameter simulations and optimizations are performed over the three time periods (currently 2030 and 2050). As a result, it was found that energy consumption has also increased and the comfort level of high-rise houses is about 10-21% higher than that of cold regions. The comfortable temperature range in these different cities is between 20 degrees C and 29 degrees C. We have showed the difference between the observed values and the model simulations (model bias) for HDD and CDD in cold and hot regions of China and Africa. This model represents spatial patterns and scales observed in Harbin, Shenzhen and South Africa. These features are characterized by an increased north-south gradient in eastern China, a topographically dependent distribution in western China and an associated increase in average temperature. The most commonly used types of heating in residential areas are heat pumps (31%) and district heating (21%). This is also the preferred case for condensing boilers (17%). In non-residential areas, heat pumps (32%), district heating (27%) and condensing boilers (11%) are the most commonly used heating systems. The total energy demand in Africa and China will be increased from 2020 to 2050. It is expected that the total demand for primary energy in China will be 8770 Mtoe in 2050, which corresponds to an increase in demand for primary energy of 1.9%, while Africa will see an increase of 2.7%. Final energy consumption in China and Africa will be 5776 Mtoe and 970 Mtoe respectively.

AB The improper disposal of agro-industrial waste poses environmental challenges and contributes to adverse climate conditions. Rice husk, with limited nutritional value for animals, is often discarded in irregular landfills or utilized for energy generation and grain drying, releasing substantial CO2 emissions. Despite literature highlighting the benefits of incorporating vegetable fibers, including rice husk, into cementitious materials, there remains a gap in understanding the durability aspect, hindering large-scale production. This research focuses on addressing this gap by investigating the influence of rice husk incorporation into a lightweight cementitious matrix (foamed concrete) on mechanical performance, aiming to specifically analyze tensile strength in flexion and compressive strength. Minimum compressive strength ranges from 1.00 to 6.00 MPa were adopted as reference values to define the proportions of materials for mixing; these values are required by standards codes for sealing materials. Through heat treatments (100 degrees C for 24 h and 300 degrees C and 650 degrees C for 1 h), the study accelerates the degradation of organic polymers in the fibers, analyzing the effects on a macro and micro scale in a Reference mixture (foamed concrete only) and a composite mixture of foamed concrete with rice husk. In the macrostructural analyses, tensile strength tests in flexion and axial compression were conducted, in the microstructural analyzes x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy tests were conducted. Unlike much of the research conducted in the area, where the aim is to increase the durability of the fibers, this study sought to analyze what happens to the composite after the degradation of the fibers. Results indicate that, even after complete degradation of organic matter, the composite exhibits superior mechanical performance compared to the Reference mixture, making it suitable for block production in masonry. After heat treatment at 100 degrees C, the compressive strength of the reference mixture (foamed concrete) decreased by 25 %, whereas the rice husk composite exhibited a more modest reduction of only 3 %. At elevated temperatures of 300 degrees C and 650 degrees C, the compressive strengths of the reference material saw substantial drops of 45 % and 64 %, respectively, while the composite experienced comparatively smaller decreases of 29 % and 52 %. The compatibility of densities between the foamed concrete matrix and the re inforcement component, along with silica content on rice husk surfaces facilitating C-S-H formation and fiber calcification, enhances resistance to axial compression. These chemical reactions contribute to mitigating strength loss caused by cellulose degradation. The confirmation that the rice husk reduces the mechanical resistance of the composite by percentages lower than those observed in foamed concrete (Reference mixture) after degradation's organic material, establishes a robust foundation for the reliable use of cementitious materials containing rice husk. This finding suggests that such materials can be employed in the production of sealing elements without significant long-term concerns.

AB Nearly zero -energy buildings (nZEBs) are one of the crucial paths to achieving carbon neutrality in the construction industry. Office park buildings have developed rapidly in recent years, and their carbon emissions cannot be ignored. At present, research on the optimization of office building envelopes mainly targets a particular office building in non -industrial parks, lacks a multi -objective comprehensive evaluation of the embodied carbon and economics of photovoltaic (PV) technology, and does not take into account the specific parameters of the PV in different PV deployment scenarios. This study, therefore, takes new office park buildings as the research object because these buildings are characterized by uniformity of type, regularity of form, and a high potential for PV application. We establish a multi-objective optimization (MOO) model for the office park building envelope, comprehensively considering energy consumption, thermal comfort, embodied carbon, and economy. The model optimizes the building envelope's performance parameters, including the PV's area and location in different PV deployment scenarios. Specifically, we consider new PV materials such as perovskite. In the hot summer and cold winter climate zones, we find that after reaching the 20 % energy-saving rate target, further improving the enclosure structure's heat preservation and insulation performance will substantially increase the incremental cost per unit area. Still, the improvement effect on energy -saving and thermal comfort is not apparent. Under both scenarios, PV on the roof and PV on both the roof and facade, the energy savings are significant, and the net energy consumption of the latter scenario( -28.4 similar to 16.5 Wh/(m(2)& sdot;a)) decreases more compared to the baseline building (23.5 kWh/(m(2)& sdot;a)). The payback benefits of the two scenarios are vastly improved from 49 years in the no PV scenario to 11-12 years, respectively.

AB Construction materials accumulate in the built environment forming material stocks (MS) of buildings and infrastructure, providing various services to society that result in a nexus of human development and environmental impact. Meanwhile, unprecedented urbanization in the Global South is set to put significant demand on the resources required to ensure adequate standards of living in new and existing urban areas. This is particularly important within India; however, no study has yet explored MS within cities in India or within master-planned urban areas designed to accommodate urbanization and a high standard of living. The present study begins to fill these gaps and aims to investigate patterns of built-environment MS accumulation in Chandigarh, an exceptionally quickly developed city master planned to ensure universally high standards of living through a unique urban form. We adopt a bottom-up approach to quantify the residential building and road MS at the city and sub-city scale. The results reveal that the master plan, while enabling high standards of living, has resulted in a relative accumulation of road-to-building stock that is significantly larger than in other cities. This is shown to be environmentally detrimental as future urban development is limited and promotes the demolition of existing stocks, whose composition severely limits their potential as secondary resources. The study therefore provides empirical evidence to support the integration of material stock assessments into urban planning and development to ensure resource-efficient provisioning of key services.

AB The construction sector plays a crucial part in the nation's growth in economic and furthermore faces growing concerns about its environmental impact. To address this, the construction industry has grown interested in life cycle assessment studies as concerns about sustainability and environmental conservation improved during the past few decades. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has evolved as a striking technology for assessing the environmental impact of products and processes in their whole life cycle. As a result, to fill this gap in the literature, a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the LCAs in the subject domain is required. The review dives into the diverse applications of LCA in construction including the assessment of building materials, construction procedures, and whole structural systems. It accentuates the significance of LCA in directing preferable materials, optimizing construction designs, and informing decision-making for ecologically conscious construction practices. Furthermore, the review explores the challenges of adopting LCA in the construction industry. Besides, the paper focuses on the potential benefits of LCA implementation in the construction area. LCA supports the reduction of carbon footprints, resource consumption, and waste creation by identifying environmental hotspots and possibilities for improvement, eventually promoting sustainable construction practices, and fostering the transition to a greener built environment. This study aims to shed a spotlight on the relevant state of LCA research as well as key terms, and developing areas in the construction. The research results of this study significantly benefit both industrial professionals and the scientific community by presenting an in-depth overview of the current status, developing concepts including challenges, as well as emerging fields of LCA in the construction sector. Furthermore, researchers interested in this topic would find this study a beneficial and valuable reference and guidance.

AB Climate change is a defining issue for our generation. The carbon footprint of clinical practice accounts for 4.7% of European greenhouse gas emissions, with the European Union ranking as the third largest contributor to the global healthcare industry's carbon footprint, after the United States and China. Recognising the importance of urgent action, the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) adopted the Glasgow Declaration on Environmental Sustainability in June 2023. Building on this initiative, the ESAIC Sustainability Committee now presents a consensus document in perioperative sustainability. Acknowledging wider dimensions of sustainability, beyond the environmental one, the document recognizes healthcare professionals as cornerstones for sustainable care, and puts forward recommendations in four main areas: direct emissions, energy, supply chain and waste management, and psychological and self-care of healthcare professionals. Given the urgent need to cut global carbon emissions, and the scarcity of evidence-based literature on perioperative sustainability, our methodology is based on expert opinion recommendations. A total of 90 recommendations were drafted by 13 sustainability experts in anaesthesia in March 2023, then validated by 36 experts from 24 different countries in a two-step Delphi validation process in May and June 2023. To accommodate different possibilities for action in high- versus middle-income countries, an 80% agreement threshold was set to ease implementation of the recommendations Europe-wide. All recommendations surpassed the 80% agreement threshold in the first Delphi round, and 88 recommendations achieved an agreement >90% in the second round. Recommendations include the use of very low fresh gas flow, choice of anaesthetic drug, energy and water preserving measures, "5R" policies including choice of plastics and their disposal, and recommendations to keep a healthy work environment or on the importance of fatigue in clinical practice. Executive summaries of recommendations in areas 1, 2 and 3 are available as cognitive aids that can be made available for quick reference in the operating room.

AB Decarbonising the energy system requires high shares of variable renewable generation and sector coupling like power to heat. In addition to heat supply, heat pumps can be used in future energy systems to provide flexibility to the electricity system by using the thermal storage potential of the building stock and buffer tanks to shift electricity demand to hours of high renewable electricity production. Bridging the gap between two methodological approaches, we coupled a detailed building technology operation model and the open-source energy system model Balmorel to evaluate the flexibility potential that decentral heat pumps can provide to the electricity system. Austria in the year 2030 serves as an example of a 100% renewable-based electricity system (at an annual national balance). Results show that system benefits from heat pump flexibility are relatively limited in extent and concentrated on short-term flexibility. Flexible heat pumps reduce system cost, CO2 emissions, and photovoltaics and wind curtailment in all scenarios. The amount of electricity shifted in the assessed standard flexibility scenario is 194 GWhel and accounts for about 20% of the available flexible heat pump electricity demand. A comparison of different modelling approaches and a deterministic sensitivity analysis of key input parameters complement the modelling. The most important input parameters impacting heat pump flexibility are the flexible capacity (determined by installed capacity and share of control), shifting time limitations, and cost assumptions for the flexibility provided. Heat pump flexibility contributes more to increasing low residual loads (up to 22% in the assessed scenarios) than decreasing residual load peaks. Wind power integration benefits more from heat pump flexibility than photovoltaics because of the temporal correlation between heat demand and wind generation.

AB Glass is transparent, durable, chemically inert, readily available, and cheap, has numerous applications in the building and construction sector, automobile sector, and optical fibers. However, glass production is not a sustainable process due to high energy requirements and associated carbon emissions. Due to the significant disadvantages and the need for sustainable production, bio-based alternative materials are the need of the hour. Transparent wood is an alternative that can replace glass. Transparent wood has a renewable origin, low energy requirements, and excellent optical and mechanical properties, especially the shatterproof behaviour. The fabrication of wood is a comparatively green process as compared to that of glass. This review paper highlights different routes of transparent wood fabrication with insights into the polymers used for infiltration into transparent wood. Good optical properties along with better mechanical properties and low thermal conductivity, low density as compared to glass, and an improved scope of multi-functionalisation have been observed for transparent wood. Studies have shown a need for a green, energy-efficient, and scalable process for the mass production of transparent wood. The key questions and areas that need to be worked upon have also been discussed. The review indicates that a systematic research approach is necessary for the overall development of the field from a research and industrial point of view.

ID CARBON SINK; PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY; REDUCTION; LCA
AB Building renovation is urgently required to reduce the environmental impact associated with the building stock. Typically, building renovation is performed by envelope insulation and/or changing the fossil-based heating system. The goal of this paper is to provide strategies for robust renovation considering uncertainties on the future evolution of climate, energy grid, and user behaviors, amongst others by applying life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis. The study includes identifying optimal renovation options for the envelope and heating systems for building representatives from all construction periods that are currently in need of renovation in Switzerland. The findings emphasize the paramount importance of heating system replacements across all construction periods. Notably, when incorporating bio-based insulation materials, a balance emerges between environmental impact reduction and low energy operation costs. This facilitates robust, equitable, and low-carbon transformations in Switzerland and similar Northern European contexts while avoiding a carbon spike due to the embodied carbon of the renovation.
   Building renovation is an urgent requirement to reduce the environmental impact associated with the building stock. In this paper, authors identify strategies for robust renovation considering uncertainties on the future and provide recommendations for the residential buildings in Switzerland.

AB Commercial banks are the main body of the finance industry in China. It is of great significance to study the impact of commercial banks' spatial agglomeration on PM2.5 for China to develop a green economy. This article selects data from 30 provinces in China, covering 2000 to 2021. This study innovatively utilizes commercial banking institutions' longitude and latitude geographic coordinate information to build a new indicator to characterize the spatial agglomeration degree of commercial banks. Then, we use the geographically and temporally weighted regression model to investigate the spatio-temporal heterogeneous effect of commercial bank agglomeration on PM2.5. The theoretical mechanism concludes that financial agglomeration exacerbates PM2.5 pollution through the scale effect and can also reduce PM2.5 pollution through technique effect and composition effect. Financial agglomeration and PM2.5 have obvious temporal and spatial differences as well as spatial autocorrelation characteristics. The geographically and temporally weighted regression model's results show that from a national perspective, financial agglomeration can inhibit PM2.5 pollution, but the inhibitory effect is gradually diminishing, indicating that it is imminent for China to further deepen its green financial reform. From the provincial level, the influence of financial agglomeration on PM2.5 has obvious temporal and spatial differences. The inhibitory effects of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei are becoming stronger, and these areas have the best situations. The promoting effects of the three northeastern provinces and Shanxi and other central and western provinces are becoming larger and larger, and these areas have the worst situations. Shanghai and other eastern provinces and Guangxi and other western provinces have respectively brought inhibitory effects and promoting effects, but the effects are all weakening, and the situations are in the middle. The scientific value of this study lies in the following: First, this study combines the environmental Kuznets curve theory for mechanism analysis, providing a scientific theoretical basis for subsequent related research. Second, the financial agglomeration index constructed in this study provides a scientific reference for academic circles to more accurately investigate the relationship between financial agglomeration and environmental pollution. Third, this study reveals the temporal and spatial differences in the impact of financial agglomeration on PM2.5 pollution by using the geographically and temporally weighted regression model for the first time, pointing out the focus and direction for decoupling economic growth and PM2.5 pollution under the influence of financial agglomeration in China provinces. With China's efforts to achieve green sustainable development, this study provides new ideas and valuable insights into the driving factors of green economic growth in China.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB In recent years, energy sharing has attracted a lot of attention. However, the intermediate platforms in centralized energy-sharing methods cause the rapid growth of communication complexity and the risk of privacy leakage. Unlike complex energy-sharing market mechanisms, in this paper, a simple and efficient distributed energy sharing for microgrids (MGs) is proposed, where game theory is employed to form flexible prices for prosumers and only local information is used to improve the privacy protection of prosumers. First, prosumers located in different areas are characterized more precisely and a two-tier carbon emission cost model is built. Next, a game-theory-based distributed energy-sharing model is proposed, where a flexible pricing mechanism is developed to enable prosumers to independently reach price agreements and achieve supply-demand balance within MGs. In the process, optimization models for obtaining equilibrium are formed and only local information is needed. However, solving these optimization models is generally time-consuming. So, a distributed optimization method based on weighted subgradients is proposed to accelerate the equilibrium-finding process. Finally, four cases are designed, and simulation results demonstrate that the prosumers' costs of our method are reduced by 7.5%-22.5% compared to the costs obtained by feed-in tariff. Moreover, in the case of solving the distributed trading model for an MG at a 24-h time scale, the iteration numbers of our method are only 38.9% and 49.3% of the two traditional solving methods.

AB Energy and environmental challenges are a major concern across the world and the urban residential building sector, being one of the main stakeholders in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, needs to be more energy efficient and reduce carbon emissions. While it is easier to design net zero energy homes, existing home stocks are a major challenge for energy retrofitting. Two key challenges are determining the extent of retrofitting required, and developing knowledge-based effective policies that can be applied en-masse to housing stocks and neighborhoods. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to gather critical data about qualities of existing buildings including their age, geo-location, construction type, as well as electro-mechanical and occupancy parameters of each dwelling. The objective of this study was to develop a GIS-based model embedded with critical data of residential buildings to facilitate evidence-based retrofit programs for urban neighborhoods. A model based on a bottom-up approach was proposed in which information gathered from all stakeholders was inputted into one database that can be used for decision-making. A geo-located case study to validate a proposed GIS-based residential retrofitting model sample size of 74 residential buildings in the city of Riyadh was statistically analyzed and used. The results indicate behavior-based patterns, with a strong positive correlation (r = 0.606) between the number of occupants and number of household appliances, while regression analysis showed high occupancy rates do not necessarily result in high utility costs at the end of the month, and there is no statistical difference in the average monthly cost of gas between partial and fully occupied houses. Furthermore, neither the type of building, height, age, nor occupancy status play a significant role in the average energy consumed. Additionally, the GIS-based model was validated and found to be effective for energy-use mapping and gathering critical data for analyzing energy consumption patterns at neighborhood scale, making it useful for municipalities to develop effective policies aimed at energy efficient and smart neighborhoods, based on a recommended list of most effective energy-saving retrofit measures.

AB There is currently a growing interest in lowering energy demand and, consequently, greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors. Several attempts by national governments to reduce energy demand are centered on the residential sector, since it accounts for a significant amount of the final energy demand. In order to estimate its energy demand and to evaluate the techno-economic effects of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, there are comprehensive models suited for residential applications, since energy demand characteristics of the residential sector are complicated and interrelated. Based on these models, several tools are nowadays available to support designers and policymakers. These tools are designed to be user-friendly and to include the possibility to develop simulated scenarios for energy demand, production of CO2 emissions, and economic costs. The present study aims to offer an up-to-date extended overview of the most functional and widespread tools for the assessment of the current energy demand of the European building stock for space heating and cooling demand, both regarding open source and commercial licenses. Results highlighted the tools most commonly used by examining real applications, identifying their strengths and weaknesses and pinpointing the primary deficiencies for the benefit of future developers.

AB The buildings and construction sector is responsible for 37% of energy-related CO2 emissions and over 34% of energy demand globally. The redevelopment of the existing residential building stock has become a consolidated policy of the European Commission to implement the objectives of economic recovery and energy transition towards climate neutrality by 2050. This paper illustrates the design experimentation conducted by the Sapienza University team on the recovery of the public housing compartment R5 in Tor Bella Monaca, Rome. The research proposes an original methodology that is ideally replicable for regenerating large public housing districts built on the outskirts of major European cities, characterised by significant technological and social degradation and energy deficiency. This paper provides an overview of the interventions and an evaluation of the method and set of tools developed in drafting the Technical and Economic Feasibility Study at both the neighbourhood and building levels. This contribution is addressed to researchers and public and private organisations dealing with the complexity of the social housing recovery topic, emphasising overall sustainability aspects of interventions in terms of typological and energy refurbishment of buildings, re-activation of open spaces and enhancement of landscape components, and envisioning new services through participatory methods that promote social inclusion.

AB The building operation sector in China represents 22% of the national energy consumption and 22% of the carbon emission, of which urban residential buildings accounted for 24% in 2019. Such figures for the housing sector are projected to increase sharply in the near future, while China aims to peak CO2 emissions by 2030 and reach neutrality before 2060. To reduce the impacts of the urban housing sector and address the energy use and waste generated by large-scale demolition and reconstruction, the central government started promoting the energy retrofit of urban residential buildings, raising such policies to the national strategic level. Jiangsu Province is one of the most urbanised, with a rapid growth in the energy consumption of residential buildings. The Multi-Danyuan and Single-Danyuan Apartment built in 1980-1999 are the most representative residential types in its urban areas. While still adequate functionally, they were designed and built to low energy standards and show significant potential for energy retrofit. Nonetheless, their current performance and energy-saving potential are under-researched, while more detailed and reliable data would be critical to support retrofit design and policy making. This study investigates and characterises the typical use and energy performance of the two building types. Additionally, seven measures and six retrofit scenarios were identified based on the optimal energy reductions and regulations from selected countries. The simulations indicate that, without intervention, the energy consumption of the typical urban residential buildings can reach 122 kWh/m2 under the typical high-energy user scenario. By selecting a set of effective energy-saving measures, the operational energy use for heating and cooling can be reduced by up to 52.4%. Current local standards prove cost-efficient, although less effective in reducing energy use compared to international best practices, indicating potential improvements to the contribution of building retrofit towards achieving the national carbon reduction goals.

AB The city of Amsterdam has ambitious goals to achieve a 95% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 and to phase out natural gas by 2040. Disconnecting the building stock from natural gas requires well-ventilated and well-insulated buildings and a switch to renewable energy sources, making optimal use of heat pumps and sustainable heating solutions available locally. Most buildings in the historical city centre are protected and often insufficiently insulated, leading to increased energy use and a poor thermal environment. Standard retrofitting interventions may be restricted, requiring new approaches to balancing the need for energy efficiency and the preservation of heritage significance. With the case of the Amsterdam City Centre, the goal of this research is to present a parametric modelling approach for energy retrofitting heritage buildings and to identify minimum requirements for preparing the residential stock to lower temperature heat (LTH). Using parametric design and bottom-up energy modelling, the research estimates that a 69.1% of natural gas reduction could be achieved when upgrading the buildings to lower temperature (LT). Results of this paper also demonstrate how the applied approach can be used to guide decisions on the improvement in energy performance of the historic built environment.

TI Circular Economy Policies for Decarbonization of US Commercial Building
   Stocks: Data Integration and System Dynamics Coflow Modeling Approach
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; PERFORMANCE; SECTOR
AB Despite the recognition of the built environment as a sector with high potential for reducing embodied emissions, there is a lack of national-level data on embodied carbon emissions attributed to the US commercial building stocks. Hence, there is a need to benchmark the current state of embodied emissions attributed to the commercial built environment and the impact of circular economy (CE) policies for their decarbonization to facilitate well-informed decision-making. This paper fills this knowledge gap through providing policy makers with a framework that estimates the current and future projections of embodied carbon emissions attributable to the US commercial building stocks and highlighting the decarbonization potential of multiple CE policies. To this end, the following multistep research methodology was adopted: (1) collecting and integrating relevant data; (2) conceptualizing and initializing a system dynamics (SD) model; (3) developing subsystems and coflow structures within the SD model using aggregated stock data from the National Energy Modeling System; (4) verifying and testing the developed SD model; and finally (5) suggesting policies and conducting scenario analysis using CE policy precedents. Findings reveal that in the baseline scenario, cumulative emissions are projected to reach 5,605 MtCO2e by 2050. As for the scenario analysis, the unit size reduction policy emerged as the most impactful single policy, achieving a remarkable 38.8% decarbonization. Whereas the comprehensive CE policy that optimizes floorspace demand and the carbon intensity of materials, exhibited a 52% decarbonization potential by midcentury. As such, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by benchmarking emissions projections, providing insights regarding CE decarbonization strategies, their associated primary stakeholders and implementation pathways. Ultimately, by embracing a holistic approach toward CE policies and harnessing accurate and standardized data on building embodied emissions, stakeholders can effectively attain decarbonization goals and promote a sustainable built environment.

AB Addressing Europe's decarbonisation challenge involves widespread deployment of nearly zero-energy buildings, deep energy renovations and renewable energy integration in the building sector. Enhancing energy efficiency in public buildings necessitates tailored solutions and strategic planning involving Local Public Administration. This work focuses on advancing insights into the application of the PrioritEE Decision Support Tool in Portuguese public buildings, highlighting the energy and financial savings and carbon dioxide emission reduction potential. Using detailed building characterisation data from energy performance certificates, we applied the tool across 22 public buildings of diverse typologies in three distinct regions of Portugal, representing various public entities. Results demonstrate the tool's adaptability, enabling a comprehensive assessment of energy performance and facilitating the exploration of customised energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions. The research emphasises the critical role of user-friendly tools in aiding policymakers and local administration technicians in meeting national renovation targets and contributing to the broader energy transition objectives.

ID SAVINGS
AB As of 2022, roughly 79.8% of Malaysia's population resides in urban areas, increasing the population density of its cities. The hot and humid climate in Malaysia necessitates the constant use of air conditioning, especially in cities, resulting in high residential electric consumption and carbon emissions. The residential sector significantly contributes to global climate change, accounting for 27% of global energy consumption and 17% of carbon emissions. To address this concern, the local framework of the National Low Carbon Cities Masterplan (NLCCM) is advocating for a minimum 33% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 in urban settings, aligning with the commitments made at the 15th Conference of Parties (COP 15). The aim of this study was to determine the energy consumption and carbon emission of residential areas in a tropical city, as well as explore potential energy and carbon savings. Utilizing the Intelligent Communities Lifecycle-Intelligent Community Design (iCL-iCD) energy simulation software, a digital twin of Bertam City, Penang, was developed. This digital model included 65.4% residential housing, which, in the specific scenario under study, accounted for 36% of the city's electrical energy consumption for cooling purposes only. An early simulation of the residential areas of the city estimated the baseline energy consumption and carbon emissions to be 607 GWh and 314,736 tCO2e, respectively. Several energy-efficient measures were applied to the residential area of Bertam City, revealing a potential saving of 37.3% in both energy and carbon emissions.

AB The aging of the building stock in most cities highlights the relevance of refurbishment to achieve sustainability. Current refurbishment practices are often short-sighted and do not encompass holistic strategies beyond energy saving. This research study aims to analyze the factors involved in roof refurbishment versus current decision-making determinants. The objective is to identify the barriers that hinder their implementation and to find arguments to support roof renovations. A multicriteria analysis, which considered environmental, economic and performance factors, was employed to select optimal roof refurbishment solutions. This study evaluated five solutions. With interviews held with construction professionals and a survey of experts and homeowners, the preferences and criteria for making decisions about roof refurbishments were analyzed. Simulation tools were then used to estimate the energy savings, payback periods and environmental impact for a representative building in the study area. The results were extrapolated to a neighborhood level. The results highlight the importance of considering factors, such as weight, cost and user preferences when selecting suitable refurbishment solutions. The findings not only estimate the potential energy savings and carbon emission reductions in the area but also underscore the relevance of roof refurbishments for prolonging a building's life span to contribute to sustainability.

AB Concerning the double carbon national strategy, the energy-saving renovation of old buildings has become one of the most important tasks of energy conservation and emission reduction in construction in China. There are many problems, such as high energy consumption, thermal environment, and poor thermal comfort. Taking Lhasa as an example, this study adopts field research, questionnaire interviews, on-site measurements, numerical simulations, and other methods to propose suitable energy-saving potential excavation points and thermal optimization strategies for office building envelopes in Lhasa through software simulation. Additionally, typical office buildings are selected to carry out the energy-saving renovation of envelopes with the goal of improving indoor thermal comfort to validate the feasibility of the energy-saving renovation strategies. The results show the following: (1) The measured and predicted thermal neutral temperatures of the office population in Lhasa are 16.5 degrees C and 18.9 degrees C, respectively. The 90% acceptable temperature range is from 16.10 degrees C to 21.77 degrees C, and the occupants of the office buildings in Lhasa have a higher tolerance for cold than predicted. (2) The passive measures adapted to Lhasa are prioritized in the order of passive solar energy, high-heat-capacity materials, and nighttime ventilation. (3) Through the optimization of the enclosure structure of existing office buildings, the improvement of the heat storage capacity of the outer enclosure structure, and the increase in the window opening area to increase natural ventilation, the indoor thermal comfort of the renovated buildings is effectively improved.

AB The increase in global average temperature, mainly due to the high rate of greenhouse gas emissions, has triggered severe global warming and climate change. In Europe, the building sector accounts for a significant portion of emissions and energy consumption, prompting attention on nearly-zero-energy buildings (nZEBs) and zero-carbon buildings, as they play a pivotal role in reaching the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. Passive systems offer a promising solution, optimizing energy usage by better adapting buildings to their local climates. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of passive heating and cooling techniques, exploring their contributions to contemporary architecture and showcasing their features and adaptability across different climates. Furthermore, the link between traditional and bioclimatic architecture is assessed. Recent years have witnessed a surge in publications on bioclimatic solar passive strategies, reflecting an intensified debate on climate change. Europe leads research in this area, aligned with initiatives like the Green Deal and Fit for 55. While dynamic simulation software is widely utilized for energy efficiency analysis, there remains limited integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and life cycle analysis (LCA) tools, which could enhance holistic assessments.

AB A substantial number of dwellings in the UK have poor building fabric, leading to higher carbon emissions, fuel expenses, and the risk of cold homes. To tackle these challenges, domestic energy efficiency policies are being implemented. One effective approach is the use of energy models, which enable sensitivity analysis to provide valuable insights for policymakers. This study employed dynamic thermal simulation models for 32 housing archetypes representative of solid-walled homes in the UK to calculate the heat loss and the sensitivity coefficient per building fabric feature, after which a metric Heat Loss Sensitivity (HLS) index was established to guide the selection of retrofit features for each archetype. The building fabric features' inputs were then adjusted to establish both lower and upper bounds, simulating low and high performance levels, to predict the how space heating energy demand varies. The analysis was extended by replicating the process with various scenarios considering climates, window-to-wall ratios, and overshadowing. The findings highlight the external wall as the primary consideration in retrofitting due to its high HLS index, even at high window-to-wall ratios. It was also established that dwelling type is important in retrofit decision-making, with floor and loft retrofits having a high HLS index in bungalows. Furthermore, the analysis underlines the necessity for Standard Assessment Procedure assessors to evaluate loft U-value and air permeability rates prior to implementing retrofit measures, given the significance of these factors in the lower and upper bounds analysis. Researchers globally can replicate the HLS index approach, facilitating the implementation of housing retrofit policies worldwide.

AB In buildings, the transfer of external and internal loads starting from the roof and the top floor should gradually be carried towards the lower floors through column elements in a safe way and eventually transmitted to the foundation system of the building and then to the ground. Thus, the reinforced concrete columns are crucial structural elements that provide essential load transfer between stories of the buildings and resist horizontal loads such as earthquakes. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of slenderness and eccentricity on achieving the most sustainable and most cost-effective design of rectangular and circular sectioned reinforced concrete columns. Slenderness is a crucial concept for bearing structural elements in pressure. Besides, the eccentricity is a frequently encountered term in practice. Unlike prior researches, this study takes the effect of slenderness, eccentricity, and cross-sectional geometry into account as well as the discrete design variables and codes of practice. The main goal of the optimization procedure is to generate a sustainable and cost-efficient reinforced concrete column design. The characteristic strength of the concrete, sizes of cross-sections, crosssectional area of longitudinal and confinement rebars and their numbers are considered as discrete design variables in optimal design problem. The Turkish Requirements for Design and Construction of Reinforced Concrete Structures (TS500) and Turkish Building Earthquake Code (TBEC), which are complement each other, are used to determine realistic design constraints of design optimization problem. Thus, two different rectangular and circular sectioned reinforced concrete columns, which have three lengths, are sustainably and cost-efficiently optimized under three different load cases considering three various eccentricities via grey wolf optimizer. Finally, the attained 108 alternative optimum designs are evaluated in terms of sustainability (CO2 emissions) and cost-efficiency as separate objective functions. Consequently, the innovative attractive design solutions are accomplished such as external loads are less effect than height of the column on the optimal design of reinforced concrete columns.

ID EMISSIONS; CONCRETE; ENERGY
AB Accounting for the embodied carbon in construction materials and calculating the carbon footprint of entire construction projects in life-cycle assessments is a rapidly developing area in the construction industry. Carbon emission accounting relies on inventories that claim to represent the values of carbon contained in materials. However, these values vary between different carbon inventories. This scoping review identifies academic research on the carbon inventories used in Australia, as well as the methods used to compare these inventories. The study was conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. We identified 182 papers and narrowed these down to 11 that complied with the objectives of this study. Data for a range of construction materials were compared in these papers, as were the methods used to calculate the values. While some carbon inventories were used frequently, no clear preference for the method of calculating carbon values was apparent. The system boundaries also varied between publications, and a range of functional units was used. There was agreement that the variables involved in calculating carbon values for building materials are compounded by the practical issues of extracting and manufacturing materials in different regional or local conditions, cultures, and technological situations. It is therefore understandable that different inventories store different values when so many factors need to be considered. There is thus a clear need for agreement to be reached about standardisation of the processes involved. If the trustworthiness of the data stored in carbon inventories is questionable, so too are the outcomes of subsequent activities.

AB The process of estimating the carbon footprint (CF) has become a key method for managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, guiding strategies for emission reduction and validating those strategies. Given the complexity of quantifying total lifecycle emissions in residential buildings, this study delves into assessing the CF focusing on water and electricity consumption in two types of residential buildings: mainly residential villas and residential flats. This assessment was carried out in Doha City, Qatar, using data on water and electricity consumption from 2017 to 2020. The study employs the Multi-Regional Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (MRIO-LCA) model to calculate and convert the water and electricity consumption data into the CF of these buildings. Further, the study employs various methods for statistical and spatial statistical analysis of CF emissions, including geographically weighted regression (GWR), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and hotspot and cold spot assessments. The annual electricity CF emissions from these buildings are approximately 7 MtCO2 equivalent, with residential villas contributing about 83% of this total. Concurrently, the annual average water CF in residential buildings is around 0.06 MtCO2 equivalent, predominantly attributed to villas. The findings highlight the substantial impact of residential structures, particularly villas, on the city's overall CF emissions. Furthermore, the findings underscore the significant impact of residential structures, especially villas, on Doha's CF emissions, revealing a marked seasonal increase, particularly during the summer months and a notable spike in 2020. The spatial analysis of CF emissions reveals consistent spatial clustering patterns across different seasons in 2020. Elevated CF emissions from villas are concentrated in Doha's central, northern, and northeastern regions, while cold spots are predominantly in the eastern and southern areas. Understanding CF in residential settings is crucial for developing strategies to reduce emissions, enhance energy efficiency, and address climate change. This research helps inform targeted interventions for more sustainable residential energy and water use, aligning with broader environmental and climate goals.

AB Through six demonstration projects of intelligent building connected to the smart grid via State Grid Corporation of China(SGCC), which are located in different areas of China with different sizes, all kinds of methods based on the smart grid for improving building power efficiency and integrated technologies are studied, changing previous energy-saving practices that mainly depend on a single product or partial technological transformation. The results of more than ten years of demonstration projects operation research indicate that the use of distributed renewable energy and power technologies such as energy storage, energy efficiency management, and demand response has enabled buildings to save energy consumption, improve the proportion and quality of green electricity, meet the peak shaving and valley filling of the power grid, and ultimately reduce carbon emissions. Not only does it reduce energy consumption by more than 15% for users, but it also provides a more comfortable and convenient building environment. The most important thing is to verify the effectiveness and long-term reliability of smart grid technology in promoting green and low-carbon buildings on the power user side. Furthermore, it provides valuable experience for the renovation and construction of low-carbon and flexible electricity-load buildings in the future.

AB This research aims to promote the sustainable utilization of locally available, environmentally friendly resources, making a substantial contribution to both mitigating global warming and fulfilling future energy needs. Hybrid renewable energy systems have demonstrated superior stability and reliability compared to single -source systems, all while operating at minimal costs. This paper provides an overview of various hybrid renewable energy systems employed for electricity generation. It underscores that in hot regions, despite high solar radiation, solar PV systems experience reduced electrical yield due to elevated solar cell temperatures beyond the recommended range, especially in summer. In such areas, leveraging solar thermal applications and abundant biomass energy from extensive agricultural activities is preferable. What sets this study apart is its innovative approach: replacing conventional hybrid systems, like PV, wind, diesel generators, and batteries, with a Stirling engine powered by dish solar concentrators, which offer high efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The proposed Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES), consisting of a parabolic dish solar concentrator and Biomass Digester (PDSC/BG), transforms challenges into opportunities. It provides the community with a sustainable source of electricity, heating, and cooking gas, simultaneously addressing the region's waste management issues. The system is evaluated at Brack City, Libya, and comprises a 36,560 m3 biomass digester that produces 27 Mm3 annually, a 1230 kW Stirling generator, and a 6006 m2 PDSC collector area. The system will add 5,670,534 kWh of energy to the grid yearly, with a peak load capacity of 1230 kWh and a coverage of 5,892,666 kWh. The system's technical and economical viability is evaluated using SAM software. The project has a 20.04-year payback period, an estimated capital cost of $12,365,896, and an LCOE of $0.075/kWh. Annual CO2 emissions will be reduced by 7.8 kton as a result of the project.

AB Urban Building Energy Models (UBEMs) are useful instruments to know the energy consumption of building stocks at urban and national levels. UBEMs can be classified into different types and subtypes. The current detailed physics-based bottom-up UBEMs at a national scale play a crucial role in assessing the energy efficiency of national building stocks and defining improvement strategies. These models heavily rely on archetypes and energy simulations, demanding significant computational resources. We propose here a new type of national-scale detailed physicsbased UBEM based on Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), and other open big data, which has the advantage that it can be automatically updated, in a short time, and with standard computer means. In this paper, we define the methodology to build this new type of national-scale EPC-based UBEM. We have checked that the model for the case of Spain can be automatically generated and updated in less than 6 h with a standard computer, and it generates results that match official data in more than 98 % for four indicators. The generated model contains information about 10,939,801 buildings in Spain, out of which 1,202,708 have EPCs. The model allows us to map and analyse the buildings in the country by integrating multiple variables of different nature, such as geographical (Autonomous Community, municipality, type of municipality), physical (area, number of floors, date of construction), use-related (main use of the building and use of each of its building units), and energy-related (climate zone, energy class, energy consumption, CO2 emissions). In this paper, we have proven that the model allows for the development of some indicators to measure the progress of decarbonisation trajectories whose development will become mandatory for European Member States soon.

AB Ninety-four percent of CO2 emissions induced by final demand in the global construction sector stem from the supply chain. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the CO2 emission hotspots within the supply chain and implement targeted reduction measures. This study proposed a supply chain clustering approach considering the functional unit of houses and identified CO2 emission hotspots within the supply chain structure of wooden houses, which accounted for approximately 90% of the total housing stock in Japan. We founded that the top ten CO2 emission clusters (i.e., emission hotspots) account for approximately 40% of the carbon footprint (38 t-CO2) of a wooden house. Specifically, the iron and steel cluster, which includes the pig iron and crude steel sectors, and the cement cluster, comprising the cement and ready -mixed concrete sectors, collectively contribute to approximately 75% of the CO2 emissions within the top 10 clusters. Therefore, the reduction of CO2 emissions from these clusters is of paramount importance. Decision-makers should promote renovation and remodeling policies for vacant houses and prioritize the reuse of foundations, predominantly constructed using steel and cement products, to reduce the supply-chain emissions from wooden houses.

AB To achieve climate and energy goals in the building sector, the current pace of renovating existing structures must double, overcoming prevailing barriers. Key Performance Indicators play a pivotal role in science-based decision making, emphasizing both direct and indirect benefits of building retrofits. The authors aim to contribute to proper metric identification for multi-perspective building performance assessment and formulate a methodology supporting energy planning decisions. They introduce the Global Cost per Emission Savings (GCES), an aggregated indicator encompassing both public (CO2 emissions) and private (global cost) perspectives of diverse retrofit technologies for building HVAC systems. Applied to the Italian residential building stock via the Reference Building approach, the methodology is tested using condensing gas boilers, biomass boilers, and electric heat pumps, revealing diverse environmental and economic performances. Addressing the establishment of effective decision-support tools for policymakers, the paper explores the potential impact of various policies on the favorability of technologies. Different policy scenarios are delineated to analyze how distinct approaches may influence the attractiveness of technologies. Notably, in the baseline scenario, biomass boilers hold an advantage over heat pumps according to the GCES index. However, scenarios involving technology-specific incentives or a greenhouse gases emission tax failed to alter the technological ranking, leaving heat pumps financially uncompetitive. In contrast, the TXPM scenario positions heat pumps as the most financially appealing option, penalizing biomass boilers for high particulate matter emissions.

There are widespread problems such as low thermal performance of building envelopes, high building energy consumption, and poor indoor thermal environments. Reducing the energy consumption of building heating by reforming the envelope structure can reduce the environmental pollution caused by heating. In this paper, the existing rural houses in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province are taken as the research object, and EnergyPlus software is used to calculate building heating energy consumption, and the schemes are compared and selected via the entropy value method. Based on a comprehensive benefit evaluation, the best scheme for the renovation of building envelopes of rural houses in Tongchuan City is put forward. The research results show that the energy saving rate of buildings can reach more than 50% after renovation. In the evaluation of energy saving, incremental cost, return on investment, carbon emission reduction and unguaranteed hours, the weights are 0.1915, 0.2104, 0.2312, 1755, and 0.187, respectively. The best renovation scheme for rural housing is as follows: the thickness of the XPS board is 90 mm for exterior wall insulation; the thickness of the XPS board is 80 mm for roof insulation; the window-to-wall ratio of additional sunspace is 0.6; and the type of exterior windows is a broken-bridge hollow aluminum window of 6 + 12A + 6 (mm).

AB For a large number of monolithic buildings in the Wenzhou area, serious cold air infiltration occurs at night due to the poor insulation performance of the enclosure structure. This results in the indoor temperature often falling below the thermal comfort zone, which is compounded by high relative humidity. Various types of energy-efficient buildings, considering different envelope structures (exterior walls, roofs, exterior windows, and shading designs), were constructed, taking into account both structural characteristics and residents' energy consumption habits. The building environment and energy consumption during the transition period (i.e., summer and winter) were analyzed using the ideal solution similarity ranking preference method (TOPSIS) and the building energy simulation software, EnergyPlus 9.5. This analysis aimed to identify four energy-efficient building models closest to the ideal solution. Comparing the indoor environment parameters and load values of the energy-saving buildings with those of the basic building yielded the following results: the average building load of the energy-saving buildings was 79.48 to 122.00 W lower than that of the basic building. The average temperature difference between the exterior walls of the energy-saving buildings and the interior temperature was 0.6 to 1.45 degrees C lower than that of the basic building. Similarly, the average temperature difference between the exterior windows and the interior temperature of the energy-saving buildings was 0.56 to 0.98 degrees C lower than that of the basic building. Additionally, the average temperature difference between the roof and room temperature of the energy-saving buildings was 0.54 to 0.39 degrees C lower than that of the basic building. Furthermore, the average indoor temperature of the energy-saving buildings was 1.50 to 2.11 degrees C higher than that of the basic building. In addition, when compared with the basic building, the energy-saving buildings could save 5.66 to 16.39 kg of standard coal and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.60 to 4.47 kg during the transition period. The study of the energy-saving envelope structure combination form in Wenzhou provides a reasonable basis for building an energy-saving envelope structure combination form in the tropical monsoon climate area, which is of great significance for reducing building energy consumption.

AB The concept of a Positive Energy District (PED) has become a vital component of the efforts to accelerate the transition to zero carbon emissions and climate-neutral living environments. Research is shifting its focus from energy-efficient single buildings to districts, where the aim is to achieve a positive energy balance across a given time period. Various innovation projects, programs, and activities have produced abundant insights into how to implement and operate PEDs. However, there is still no agreed way of determining what constitutes a PED for the purpose of identifying and evaluating its various elements. This paper thus sets out to create a process for characterizing PEDs. First, nineteen different elements of a PED were identified. Then, two AI techniques, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), were introduced and examined to determine their potential for modeling, extracting, and mapping the elements of a PED. Lastly, state-of-the-art research papers were reviewed to identify any contribution they can make to the determination of the effectiveness of the ML and NLP models. The results suggest that both ML and NLP possess significant potential for modeling most of the identified elements in various areas, such as optimization, control, design, and stakeholder mapping. This potential is realized through the utilization of vast amounts of data, enabling these models to generate accurate and useful insights for PED planning and implementation. Several practical strategies have been identified to enhance the characterization of PEDs. These include a clear definition and quantification of the elements, the utilization of urban-scale energy modeling techniques, and the development of user-friendly interfaces capable of presenting model insights in an accessible manner. Thus, developing a holistic approach that integrates existing and novel techniques for PED characterization is essential to achieve sustainable and resilient urban environments.

AB The twenty-first century is known as the "century of the ocean." Artificial reefs have been extensively studied and used worldwide as the main infrastructure of marine pastures. At present, research has been primarily focused on developing new environmentally friendly artificial reef construction materials with low emissions, low alkalinity, low cost, and great durability. As a novel low-carbon and environmentally friendly construction material, geopolymer presents considerable potential for building artificial reefs. By changing the alkali-activator dosage, this investigation prepared fly ash geopolymer concrete (FGC) with different strength grades. FGC's mechanics, durability, and marine environmental compatibility were systematically studied as a marine artificial reef construction material. The effect of curing temperature on the performance of FGC was also investigated. Results indicated that the design grade of FGC against sulfate erosion can reach above KS150, and the maximum electric flux of the experimental group is 300.76 C. Moreover, FGC has good compatibility with marine environments. High-temperature maintenance can significantly improve each performance of FGC. Microstructural analysis was performed through a scanning electron microscope secondary electron (SEM-SE), SEM backscattered electrons (SEM-BSE), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and a mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP). Results showed that the FGC matrix porosity decreases with the increase of alkali-activator dosage, which causes denser pore structures. In addition, the active calcium-containing components in the calcareous aggregate will participate in the geopolymer reaction and generate calcium-rich gel in the interfacial transition zone (ITZ), thus enhancing the mechanical and durability of the material. In conclusion, as a low-carbon construction material, FGC has a broad application prospect in marine artificial reef construction.

AB The energy and environmental policy carried out by the Port System Authority of the Strait (AdSP), in charge of the management of the ports spread along the Strait of Messina, is reported. The Environmental and Energy Planning Document of Port Systems (DEASP, the Italian acronym) is the document explaining the AdSP sustainable strategy to reduce GHG emissions. It defines specific measures, in order to improve energy efficiency in buildings and infrastructures, promote the use of renewable energy in the port area, and confer environmental benefits for the citizens of neighboring territories and port users. The main actions developed are as follows: photovoltaic solar plants and tidal energy systems, electrification of the docks to allow the shore supply of ships, and the construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage plant to replace more polluting marine fuels, together with awareness campaigns on "green" issues, involving the 3 million users of these ports. Starting from the socio-economic and environmental analysis of the territorial context managed by AdSP, the DEASP analyses all the activities carried out inside port areas and reports the energy consumptions of the concessionaries, in the way to calculate the carbon footprint and develop an environmental sustainable strategy to reduce pollutant emissions. The interventions foreseen are assessed through the cost-benefit analysis and allow reducing the GHG emissions in 2030 up to 46%.

AB Buildings, infrastructure, and durable goods are essential for human activities. Understanding their relationship with socioeconomic development is crucial for optimizing resource allocation in urban settings, thereby enhancing efficiency and lessening environmental impact. This study delves into the urban material stock evolution in China's megacities, spanning 111 distinct end-use stocks. From 1978 to 2018, in-use stocks witnessed a substantial surge, increasing from a modest <350 Mt to an astounding 819-3130 Mt across cities-an average annual growth rate ranging from of 4.7 to 15.2 %. This growth was paralleled by improvements in stock productivity, associated with reductions in CO2 emissions by 154-505 Mt and conservation of significant amounts of energy and food resources. As urbanization approaches the 80 % mark, a mere 1 % rise results in considerable increments of 13.5, 1.9, and 0.6 t in per capita stocks of buildings, infrastructure, and durable goods. Our results shed light on strategies for resource circulation, stock management, and sustainable urban future trajectories.

AB As the preeminent carbon emitter globally, China's endeavor to peak carbon emissions by 2030 is crucial for ecological preservation and sustainable development. The carbon emissions from buildings account for approximately half of China's total carbon emissions. Due to regional heterogeneity among different provinces, it's imperative to conduct research on provincial residential building carbon emissions. Fujian Province, as China's first ecological civilization pilot area, urgently needs to propose effective emission reduction recommendations. This study employs a Kaya-LMDI-SD-MC framework to systematically analyze and dynamically predict peak carbon emissions from residential buildings in Fujian, as well as to explore the emission reduction pathways. Results show that (1) GP emerges as the dominant positive driver, contributing 10.8305 mt and with a remarkable rate of 161.38 %, contrasted by EG as the most pronounced negative influence with a 99.68 % contribution. (2) Although none of the assessed scenarios met the peak emission targets, BDS is identified as the most viable, projecting residential building carbon emissions in 2030 to be 35.42 mt. (3) Dynamic simulations indicate a 90 % probability that Fujian's 2030 emissions will span 35.75 to 38.24 mt, peaking around 37.00 mt. Overall, the study provides actionable policy recommendations, offering a foundational reference for China's provincial carbon management, with broader implications for global peak carbon initiatives, and contributing to the development of sustainable cities and society.

AB PurposeIn recent times, both academics and industrialists have undertaken research into various areas of circular business models (CBM) in a bid to promote a green economy. Yet despite numerous studies conducted, the ensuing discourse contains scant information regarding the contributions of CBM towards the transition of green economy in the construction industry. This present study therefore aims to explore the contributions of CBM in the transition towards a green economy in the Ghanaian construction industry.Design/methodology/approachA comprehensive literature review was first conducted to identify the contributions of CBM towards the transition towards a green economy. A quantitative research strategy was then adopted to collect primary questionnaire data from professionals with knowledge of CBM and the green economy from 104 participants for the study. The data gathered was analyzed using descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis viz. Principal component analysis.FindingsThe contributions of CBM towards the transition towards a green economy were found to be: value contributions (i.e. lower carbon footprint, lower emission of waste by the industry, value creation for clients, innovation in construction materials and methods, reduced maintenance cost, creation of energy efficient infrastructures, improved value proposition for firms, improved sustainability of the industry and reduced pressure on finite resource.); green contributions (i.e. recycling and reuse of construction waste, promotion of green building technology, increased potential for economic growth, increased resource efficiency and creation of green building market) and longevity contribution (i.e. increased life span of buildings). It was evident that CBM make significant contributions in the transition towards green economy and as such, policymakers and other stakeholders within the construction industry must adopt these models to maximize their green credentials and accrue inherent benefits associated with transitioning towards a green economy.Originality/valueThis paper presents a novel and comprehensive study that explores the contributions of CBM towards engendering a green economy. The study's results provide construction industry stakeholders and policymakers with clear insight into the contributions of CBM towards the transition into a green economy. In practice, this study provides much needed guidance to support construction practitioners to transition towards a green economy in alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AB The scientific evaluation of carbon -emission trends and pathways for carbon reduction in China's provincial buildings can play a crucial role in achieving the goals of carbon peaking and neutrality. In this study, a new carbon -emission simulation model was developed using a bottom -up approach for Shaanxi Province. The model incorporated various influencing factors, such as building area, building type, building -energy efficiency and energy -consumption structure, while quantifying the area parameters through building metabolism. This study combines relevant literature, policies and regional resource conditions to create a single scenario of carbonreduction measures, including the application of green building materials, structural adjustments to buildingenergy consumption, improvements in building -energy efficiency and increased carbon sinks in buildings. We arranged and combined these scenarios into nine different combinations. We predicted the trends in carbonemission changes in Shaanxi's urban and rural buildings in the operational phase from 2020 to 2060 under single and combined scenarios; moreover, we quantified and analysed the carbon -reduction contributions of each carbon -reduction measure in the green and low -carbon realisation pathways of urban and rural buildings. The findings of this study revealed the following key points. (1) Structural adjustments to building -energy consumption have the greatest potential for carbon reduction and play a central role in achieving a green, lowcarbon pathway. In the later stages of carbon -emission forecasting, when structural adjustments to buildingenergy consumption reach saturation, improvements in building -energy efficiency become crucial for influencing carbon -emission changes. (2) Through a carbon -reduction pathway centred on the improvement of building -energy efficiency and structural adjustments to building energy consumption, with green building material application and carbon sink increase as supporting measures, Shaanxi's urban and rural buildings are expected to achieve carbon neutrality by around 2059, with carbon emissions of -902,200 tCO2. Under the China Development Goal of Carbon Neutrality for 2060, this is a green, low -carbon pathway for urban and rural buildings in Shaanxi Province. (3) In the green and low -carbon pathways for urban and rural buildings in Shaanxi Province, the top three contributors to carbon -emission reduction were increasing the share of green electricity applications (49.14%), reducing traditional energy consumption (18.56%) and increasing the proportion of new low -carbon buildings (16.81%). This study provides a scientific foundation and decision -making reference for the formulation of green and low -carbon development pathways for urban and rural construction in China's Shaanxi Province.

AB Energy retrofitting of existing buildings plays a key role in the European targets of Green House Gas reduction. The addition or substitution of construction materials is needed to improve energy performance of buildings and its environmental impact must be considered. This paper proposes a model for the assessment of the environmental impact of neighborhood retrofit in relation with urban density. The model is based on the decomposition of buildings into functional elements and the quantification of construction materials used in building energy retrofitting. As a novelty, the need of road rehabilitation was also considered. The environmental impact was assessed in terms of Embodied Energy (EE) and Embodied Carbon (EC). The operational energy after retrofit was also calculated. The results bring the evidence of the relation between the urban density and the EE and EC derived from building retrofit, which can be up to 60% higher in low density areas. The sensitivity analysis carried out demonstrates the influence of the urban compactness on the environmental assessment results. The model proposed can assist in the design of retrofit plans at urban level by highlighting those retrofit measures with most significant environmental impact depending on the urban density.

AB Introduction: South Africa is ranked among the 20 highest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters worldwide, mainly due to its heavy reliance on coal for energy. The residential building industry can play a significant role towards the minimization of both GHG emissions and energy consumption. This research assesses the beneficial impacts of utilizing wall envelope insulation measures using five insulation materials, for a detached residential building, within the seven energy zones of South Africa in accordance with the South African National code for Building energy efficiency (SANS10400-XA).Methods: Lifecycle analysis (for 50 years), regression methods and sequential search techniques of building energy modelling were used to determine both the energy saving implications of adopting the insulation materials (at various levels of thickness), and their corresponding energy payback periods. The study area consisted of eight selected locations representing all the seven energy zones in South Africa (Welkom, Witbank, Thohoyandou, Cape Town, Pretoria, Ixopo, Sutherland, and Fraserburg).Results: Sutherland (zone 6), Cape Town (zone 4) and Fraserburg (zone 7) benefitted most from energy savings due to application of insulation measures. Witbank (Zone 2), Thohoyandou (zone 3) and Pretoria (zone 5) never benefitted from application of wall envelope insulation (in terms of energy savings). Cellulose and straw yielded the lowest payback periods. Generally, polyurethane yielded the highest net energy savings at lower insulation thickness levels, while cellulose was preferable at higher insulation thickness levels in Welkom (zone1) Cape Town (zone 4), Ixopo (zone 5H), Sutherland (zone 6) and Fraserburg (zone 7).Discussion: Lower optimal wall envelope insulation thicknesses (that maximized energy savings) appeared to correspond to locations with higher annual temperature ranges. Higher temperature ranges (hence, higher degree days) would ensure that more energy is saved in order to keep the indoor temperatures within the acceptable comfort limits, due to application of insulation. However, the selection of insulation material is also influenced by other factors such as resistance to insect and mould attack (which easily affect bio-insulation materials), fire retardancy, durability (which affects cellulose), sound proofing, structural strength, and resistance to water vapour.

AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) play a crucial role in architectural education, as buildings contribute 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions and 40% of extracted materials are used in construction. This research investigates the current status of SDG integration in architecture education, its challenges, and potential future advancements. A qualitative survey was conducted among architecture educators from 22 institutions across nine countries, focusing on four key aspects: (i) general knowledge and understanding of the SDGs; (ii) qualification and experience regarding the SDGs; (iii) integration of the SDGs in architecture education; and (iv) implementation of the SDGs in architectural practises. The findings revealed that most educators did not receive formal education focused on the SDGs, relying on self-exposure and self-learning. SDG 11 was the most adopted, focusing on improving slum areas, providing safe housing, and promoting sustainable urban settlements while preserving cultural heritage.

AB Construction activities discharge considerable carbon emissions, causing serious environmental problems and gaining increasing attention. For the large-scale construction area, high emission intensity, and significant carbon reduction potential, embodied carbon emissions of buildings worth special studying. However, previous studies are usually post-evaluation and ignore the influences of project, construction and management. This paper focuses on critical building materials and adopts machine learning methods to realize carbon prediction at design stage. The activity data, including critical building materials, water, and energy consumption, is analyzed and 30 influencing factors at the project, construction, and management levels are identified. Three algorithms (artificial neural network, support vector regression and extreme gradient boosting) are used to develop machine learning models. The proposed methodology is applied to 70 projects in the Yangtze River Delta region of China. Results show that the established models achieved high interpretability (R2 >0.7) and small average error (5.33%), well proving theirs feasibility. Furthermore, an automated tool is developed to assist practitioners to predict the critical materials consumption and embodied carbon emissions conveniently. The proposed operable model and practical tool can efficiently support effective adjustments and improvement to reduce carbon in construction.

AB As cities grow, demand for urban materials is set to rise. Meeting sustainability targets will require transformative changes to how cities are constructed. Yet, accurate information on embodied building materials and their environmental impacts at the city scale is still lacking. We use Light Detection and Ranging data, building archetype information, and statistical models to estimate the embodied materials in buildings in Canberra, Australia, and their energy, carbon, and water footprint. In 2015, 57 million tonnes (Mt) of materials were embodied in 140,805 buildings. By weight, concrete was the most used material (44%), followed by sand and stone (32%), and ceramics (11%). Current population growth and building construction trends indicate a need for 2.4 times the building materials stock of 2015 by 2060. Producing such materials would require 1.6 thousand TJ of energy and 793 thousand megaliters of water and emit 48 Mt of CO2e-an environmental footprint 1.6 times the one in 2015. If the additional population were to live only in new single houses, material demand would be 4% higher than under current trends and the environmental footprint 5% higher. Housing new residents in low-rise apartments would reduce from current trends the material demand by 5% and the environmental footprint by 12%. Using only apartments of four or more stories would reduce material demand by 28% and the environmental footprint by 14%. This research can inform circular economy efforts to improve building materials management by helping estimate the implications of alternative configurations of the urban built environment.

AB Visual information acquisition is essential for our daily lives, with vision relying on the presence of light. Lighting systems serve the fundamental purpose of enabling vision. This study aims to contribute to sustainable architectural design by emphasizing the efficient utilization of natural daylight. Specifically, the design of skylights or light wells in low-lateral-area, deep-depth structures is of significant importance. While current design criteria consider skylight dimensions and the skylight-to-building height ratio, these factors alone may not suffice for optimal skylight design. To achieve an appropriate lighting and architectural design for such structures, it is essential to evaluate the factors influencing the required amount of daylight on different floors. This study aims to investigate the impact of skylights and light wells on the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of a four-storey building located in Hail, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The physical parameters of skylights and light wells were analyzed, taking into account various aspects that affect the amount of light reaching different levels. The findings highlight the significant influence of skylight size on the light reaching the building's floors. For square skylights, reducing the well index (increasing skylight size) exponentially increases the daylight factor. Furthermore, this study evaluates the annual energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of the building, considering the daylighting factor. The results demonstrate that skylights contribute to increased solar heat gain, thermal conductance, and artificial lighting efficiency. Notably, as the lighting factor of the building increases from 3% to 6%, there is an annual decrease of 3% in CO2 emissions.

AB As the world's largest developing nation, China has emerged as the predominant carbon emitter due to its swift industrialization and urbanization. Achieving low-carbon development in China necessitates a tailored approach that accounts for each city's unique industrial phase, technological advancements, urbanization level, and resources. This research endeavors to elucidate the nonlinear mechanism influencing carbon emissions in Chinese cities using a machine-learning framework, drawing on panel data from 290 cities from 2000 to 2017. The result indicates that China is experiencing a transition in the primary drivers of carbon emissions from the agriculture sector to the industrial and service sectors. A city transitions to the carbon decoupling phase when the outputs of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries surpass 1500, 125,000, and 100,000 CNY per capita, respectively. Additionally, we observed that expanding the urban built-up area beyond 10% can significantly mitigate carbon emission intensity. However, the study also highlights a critical challenge: the initial emission-reducing effects of innovation in burgeoning high-tech industries are negated by the higher emissions from traditional industries. Moreover, our analysis indicates that R&D investments exceeding RMB 8000 per capita may paradoxically lead to an increase in emissions. With these conclusions of nonlinearity, we emphasize designing policies tailored to the specificities of each city, stressing the importance of adaptability in policy creation.

AB This research paper analyses the potential of multi-angled facade systems to achieve the sustainability goals of reduced energy consumption and improved indoor climate quality, hence aligning with UN SDGs 3, 11, 12 and 13. The objective of this research paper is to define the suitable glass properties for the two windows of the multiangled facade. The concept of a multi-angled facade system is based on proposing using two different window orientations in each facade on a vertical axis (right and left), but not tilted up and down. The large part of the multi-angled facade is oriented more to the north to optimise the use of daylight and the small part of the multiangled facade more to the south to optimise the use of solar radiation through the facades. One can optimise using daylight and solar heat inside the office room through the multi-angled facade design concept, but with less complexity in the design, manufacture, and transport phases. This is the gap between 3D facades and the new multi-angled facade system concept, which indicates its novelty. To evaluate the energy consumption, the researcher used the software program IDA ICE version 4.8. to analyse the energy behaviour through the facade and the building's indoor climate, to compare the glass property impacts. The researcher modelled five scenarios for a multi-angled facade with different glass properties in both parts of the multi-angled facade. Researchers have used this software in simulations to validate, test, and compare statistics for more than 25 years according to ASHRAE 140, 2004, and CEN Standard EN 15255 and 15265, 2007. To conduct the analysis for the material's embodied energy in the multi-angled facade, the researcher used the software LCAbyg version 5 and compared it with the situation for a flat facade. The results for the energy consumption results revealed that the energy behaviour in the first scenario's glass type is recommended because the illumination was better and offered lower total yearly energy consumption and the accepted number of overheating hours inside the office room. The result of the embodied energy for the materials of the multi-angled facade shows that the area-weighting of the sum of the total energy consumption through the building's lifetime and embodied energy is higher when one renovates with a flat facade by about 11%.

AB A large-scale offshore wind power integration has a reverse peak regulation effect on the electric load and requires newly built transmission corridors. This work adopts a wind -thermal (WT) bundled system for offshore wind power integration and transmission line capacity factor improvement. The Qingzhou I -VII offshore wind farms (5000 MW) and the Yangxi coal-fired power plant units #5, #6 (2 x 1240 MW) are taken as a case study. The offshore wind farms (OWF) act as the must-take generator to increase the renewable fraction while the thermal power plants (TPP) provide peak regulation service to trace the changing net load. The OWF and TPP share the transmission line and point of interconnection. The OWF integration level is determined by the 8760-h production simulation and the wind -thermal (W -T) capacity ratio is 1.4516:1 (3600 MW OWF) in the studied site. The curtailment rate, electricity shortage rate, transmission line capacity factor (CF), load following precision, renewable fraction, CO2 emission of WT-W3600 condition are 9.02%, 5.41%, 61.36%, 91.43%, 50.46%, 6.97 million ton/year. There is a trade-off relationship between renewable fraction and curtailment rate in the WT system which restricts higher OWF integration. The demand-side response technologies such as power -to -X and energy storage are required to break the trade-off relation and reduce the electricity shortage rate. The WT system is economically viable and the net present value (NPV), levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), internal rate of return (IRR) of WT-W3600 are 3.55 billion yen , 0.4859 yen /kWh, 4.82%. Co-locating the OWF and the floating solar photovoltaic (PV) is the future direction that benefits the intensive exploitation of sea area and offshore renewable energy development.

AB In order to save heating energy and reduce carbon emission intensity, a floor heating room with built-in finned Trombe wall in Xining, Qinghai, a severe cold area, was taken as the research object. And ANSYS 2021 R1 was used to numerically investigate the effects of several major factors, such as fin height, fin transverse distance, fin longitudinal distance, fin inclined angle, fin shape, perforated shape and perforation ratio of perforated fin, on the average heat transfer coefficient (h) between the absorptive surface and the air in the interlayer. The results show that for fins with low heights, the enhancement effect of horizontal fins on the convective heat transfer of the absorptive surface of Trombe wall is greater than that of vertical fins. The enhancement effect of vertical fins on the convective heat transfer of the absorptive surface is more affected by fin transverse distance, while the enhancement effect of horizontal fins on the convective heat transfer of the absorptive surface is more affected by fin longitudinal distance. Besides, h shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increase of fin inclined angle, and reaches its maximum value of 5.89 W/(m(2).K) at 45. The fins with different shapes are equilateral triangular fins, semicircular fins, isosceles triangular fins and rectangular fins in descending order of their enhancement effect on the heat transfer of wall. Compared with solid fins, fins with circular holes can obtain a better convective heat transfer effect only when the open area ratio is 1:6. While fins with equilateral triangular holes can obtain better convective heat transfer effect as long as the open area ratio is greater than 1:7. Fins with elliptical holes do not significantly improve the heat transfer effect. On the basis of optimizing the fin layout and structure, the thermal performance of the improved Trombe wall during the 8:00 similar to 16:00 period and its impact on indoor thermal comfort of the building were studied, and the energy -saving performance of the plan was discussed. Compared with the Trombe wall room with no fins, the improved Trombe wall can improve the heat teransfer efficiency and the building energy saving rate by 68.50 % and 53.57 %, respectively. The improved Trombe wall can only ensure the indoor thermal comfort in limited several hours, in the rest of time, the residents should add clothing to keep warm. These conclusions have an important effect of engineering guidance and great realistic meanings for promoting the process of solar building integration and achieving the "carbon peak and carbon neutrality" target.

AB Cities that are characterized by high populations and economic activities are carbon-intensive and highly susceptible to the effects of climate change. The majority of existing research on urban low-carbon development employs macro models to analyze influencing factors and emission pathways; however, such studies do not derive detailed descriptions about urban structure, commuting mode and residential characteristics, or capture cities' dynamic evolution. This study develops a non-equilibrium dynamic urban model specifically for Beijing (NEDUM-Beijing) that is based on existing NEDUM-2D to capture housing construction, residential housing, and commuting patterns specific to Beijing. Using the model, this study simulates and analyzes the impacts of lowcarbon development policies on urban expansion, pollution reduction, carbon mitigation, and residents' livelihood (2025-2060). Results show that carbon tax and new energy vehicle policies have limited effect on urban form and do not substantially cause urban sprawl. A carbon tax of 100 yuan/ton appears insufficient to achieve considerable reduction in CO2 and PM2.5 emissions. The promotion of new energy vehicles can reduce transportation emissions slightly, with a long -term reduction ratio of 0.54%-2.62%. Restricting the residential land and floor area ratio may reduce overall housing supply, cause lower average dwelling size, and encourage suburban relocation.

AB This study examines the total carbon emissions of Hong Kong, which ranked 74th among 218 countries in 2021, with a focus on the contribution of building energy use. Using data from open sources at ourworldindata.org and data.gov.hk from 2001 to 2020, a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model is developed to predict the trajectory of carbon emissions. The significance of regression coefficients is tested using bootstrap confidence intervals, and jackknife cross-validation is employed to evaluate the model's performance. The study identifies nine significant predictors, including commercial electricity consumption, private office area, and private commercial building area, among others. The findings indicate that the current carbon reduction trend is insufficient to meet the target in 2030. To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the study proposes a decarbonization roadmap involving a 30-40 % reduction in commercial building electricity consumption and a decreased carbon emission factor. The study underscores the importance of strategic energy management for air conditioning systems and the promotion of green building projects in effectively decarbonizing Hong Kong.

AB Land use and land cover (LULC) will cause large flows of carbon sources and sinks. As the world's largest carbon emitter with a complicated LULC, China's carbon emissions have profound implications for its ecological environment and future development. In this paper, we account for the land-use changes and carbon emissions of 30 Chinese provinces and cities in China from 2000 to 2020. Furthermore, the spatial correlation of carbon emissions among the study areas is explored. Four typical regions with spatial association (Beijing, Hebei, Sichuan, and Anhui) are selected, and their land-use change trends in 2025 and 2030 are simulated to predict the total carbon emissions in the future. The results show that the distribution of land-use in China is mainly cultivated and woodland, but the growth of urban built-up (UBL) land area indirectly leads to the continuous increase of carbon emissions. Total carbon emissions have increased over the past two decades, albeit at a slower growth rate, with some provinces experiencing no further growth. In the typical regional carbon emission simulation, it is found that the carbon emissions of the four provinces would show a downward trend in the future. The main reason is the reduction in indirect carbon emissions from fossil energy in UBL, while the other part is the influx of carbon sinks due to grassland, woodland, etc. We recommended that future carbon reduction measures should focus and prioritize controlling fossil energy and mitigating carbon emissions from UBL. Simultaneously, the significant contribution of forests and other land types as carbon sinks should be acknowledged to better implement China's carbon neutral commitment.

AB The emergence of ultra-dense 5G networks and a large number of connected devices will bring with them significant increases in energy consumption, operating costs, and CO2 emissions. At the same time, the deployment of distributed photovoltaic (DPV) in megacities plays an important role in promoting the integration of "buildingphotovoltaic", adjusting the city's clean energy supply system, and building a green, and low-carbon smart city. The development of a new "DPV-5G Base Station-Energy Storage (DPV-5G BS-ES)" coupled DC microgrid system and its pre-deployment investment costs are fundamental factors to be considered when the problem of largescale DPV and BS deployment in cities has to be addressed. There are almost no published papers on this issue in the literature, which only consider the problem of maximizing the deployment of 5G BS service coverage or only perform optimization analyses for the performance of microgrid systems without considering the economic optimality and low-carbon green issues in the construction of urban utilities. In order to solve the problem of 5G BS deployment and economic optimization of topology in the "DPV-5G BS-ES" coupled DC microgrid system, a novel deployment strategy is proposed in this paper. The strategy is divided into: (a) The Geographic Information System (GIS) for extracting and analyzing 3D data from all buildings in the area. (b) A GIS-based formulation of a mixed integer quadratic constrained planning model (BSSCP) under discrete fixed radius coverage constraints is used to delineate building clusters within the area and determine the optimal deployment location of 5G BS under each sub-cluster. (c) An Improved Self-Organizing Mapping (ISOM) model combines GIS and microgrid performance parameters to address the economically optimal connection of grid lines for DPV in 3D space. (d) Simulation experiments were conducted for the power output and profitability of eight different PV panels and tracking systems to calculate the economically optimal type of DPV generation hardware. The experimental results show that the BSSCP model proposed in this study reduced the 5G BS deployment cost input by up to 35.8974 % compared to that of the control experimental model. Meanwhile, the ISOM model obtained an average reduction of 52.3741 % in the cost of connecting cables for the optimized 25 DPV planning and DC microgrid topology.

ID SYSTEM; DESIGN
AB In order to reduce the energy consumption of buildings, an air source heat pump assisted rooftop photovoltaic-thermal integration system is designed. The installation area of photovoltaic modules and collectors will not only affect the power side, but also affect the thermal side. Therefore, the basic architecture of the photovoltaic photothermal integration system is first established, and then the improved whale algorithm is used to optimize the photovoltaic photothermal integration system with the daily operating cost as the optimization goal. At the same time, the influence of the installation area of the photovoltaic photothermal module on the comprehensive performance of the system is analyzed, and the environmental and economic benefits of the photovoltaic photothermal system are analyzed. The results of the example show that the roof of the building has significant benefits in environmental protection and investment recovery period when the photovoltaic photothermal system with the optimal area ratio is installed on the roof of the building. The solar photovoltaic power generation system can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 147.11 t within 25 years, and the solar collector system can save 170.5 thousand yuan in 1 year. It has achieved the purpose of saving energy, reducing carbon dioxide emissions and protecting the environment.
